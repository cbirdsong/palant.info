<p>I would most likely be classed as a 'nobody', but I'm trying to understand how PBKDF2 affects how hard it would be for the threat-actor to crack/decrypt my vault <em>if</em> they decided to try it. I had 100,100 iterations set on my account.  Am I correct in understanding that 100,100 iterations slows down the speed at which they can attempt to crack my password to approximately 88,000 guesses per second if they were using an RTX 4090 - regardless of the length of my password?  That suggests to me that 8-10 character passwords that are reasonably strong would take a fair bit of effort to crack?  I ask because I'm looking cracking speeds from GRC's https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm and it seems PBKDF2, while flawed, does considerably slow down cracking speeds versus just raw attempts at guessing?</p>
