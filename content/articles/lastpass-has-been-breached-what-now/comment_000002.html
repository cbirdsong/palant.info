<p>I keep reading glowing articles about how WebAuthn will virtually eliminate credential compromises, but this (latest) breach serves as a reminder of the old phrase, "don't put all of your eggs in one basket." By storing all of your credentials, whether passwords or tokens, in a single web-accessible service used by millions of people, you inherently create a very appetizing target. Yes, they are presumably far better skilled at cybersecurity than the average user, but a single chink in the armor (or malicious insider) has far greater reach. Given how much time the hackers have already had to crack the hashes of targeted accounts, here's to the futile hope that all of the downstream services accessed with those LastPass-"protected" passwords also require hardware security keys.</p>
<p>Side question for LastPass: why are archived backups containing all that metadata not fully encrypted? Sigh!</p>
