<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/" rel="nofollow">LastPass revealed that they had been breached</a> and then a few days later that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/lastpass-hack-was-even-worse-than-originally-reported-should-you-delete-your-account" rel="nofollow">that their customer’s encrypted password data was stolen</a>.
