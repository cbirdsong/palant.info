<p>2FA is part of the login process which is required to access the vault data – it generally doesn’t help here, the attackers have the vault data already. Presumably, Yubikey isn’t used as a password replacement, meaning that it won’t prevent decryption which is still dependent on the master password only.</p>
<p>Whatever configuration changes you implemented <em>after</em> the data was stolen also don’t affect anything unfortunately.</p>
