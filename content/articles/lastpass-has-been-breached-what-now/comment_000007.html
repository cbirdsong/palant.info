<p>Hey Wladimir, first of all thanks for all your research work and the incredible documentation and reporting you did. Too bad i discovered your informative site only now.
Do you have any take on Bitwarden ? and would you chose the self hosting approach or trust their services/interface/apis etc. Also would you use a browser extension or rather a standalone app which goes to a (possibly time limited) copy and paste procedure on logins ?</p>
