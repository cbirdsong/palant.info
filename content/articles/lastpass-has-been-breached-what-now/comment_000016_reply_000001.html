<p>Yes, I did more detailed time and cost estimates in <a href="https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/" rel="nofollow">https://palant.info/2022/12/28/lastpass-breach-the-significance-of-these-password-iterations/</a>. These apply to a truly random 8 character password. If your password isn’t random, even at 10 characters it will be considerably easier to guess.
