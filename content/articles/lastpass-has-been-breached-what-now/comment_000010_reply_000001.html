<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea. Presumably, that’s the Federated Login Services that LastPass mentions in their blog post. According to LastPass, a hidden master password is used in this scenario. As this one should be random, it would in principle prevent bruteforce attacks. Unless the attackers somehow accessed the master password itself which LastPass claims they didn’t. I have not looked into how this is implemented, so I cannot tell whether there are any design flaws here.</p>
