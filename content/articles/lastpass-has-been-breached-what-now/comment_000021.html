<p>Hi Wladimir</p>
<p>many thanks for your valuable insights! One final question that I haven't spotted the answer to anywhere is whether it is worth changing the master password for LP at this point. Does it help secure the data that was breached a few months ago by improving the LP master password now, or is the master password at the time of the breach the one that needs to be cracked?</p>
<p>I am not worried about the strength of my master password per se, as it has always been very high, and iterations were luckily set to 100,100. I am only considering really going to town on strength to future proof against future technology advances. </p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
