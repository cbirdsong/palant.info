<p>Regardless, LastPass can't be trusted. This is as bad as it gets really...especially admins!</p>
<p>Start a 1Password account w/32-char min master pass, set up 2FA, and begin the painful process:</p>
<p>Login with LastPass, for-each site/note: change the password and store it in 1Password, and delete from LastPass... process of elimination and it makes 100% sure you get them all changed.</p>
<p>Start with the highest value sites first of course.</p>
<p>1Password has some good passkeys stuff in the 2023 pipeline. Can't wait to be passwordless someday!</p>
