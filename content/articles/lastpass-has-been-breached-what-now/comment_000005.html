<p>Thanks for the detailed article!</p>
<p>I also note that Bitwarden use the same outdated encryption methods. I wonder why this is?</p>
<p>Out of interest, do hardware keys (I.e yubikey) make this a non issue? Iâ€™m not exactly sure how these keys work but expect they are storing a 32-64 long key, similar to a crypto hardware wallet.</p>
<p>At this time, these are not able to be brute forced, right?</p>
