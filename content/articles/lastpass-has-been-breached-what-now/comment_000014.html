<p>Hi Wladimir, thank you very much for such a great analysis and recommendations.
I've spent a lot of time updating my most important accounts, it's been a nightmare.</p>
<p>I've also removed Lastpass authenticator and moved to Yubico Authenticator as I can imagine that the stolen vault also includes the information from the TOTP acounts sync'ed on the cloud.</p>
<p>If I have Yubikeys as the only 2FA for LastPass, does it mean my vault is more secure?</p>
<p>After I've changed the most important passwords, added 2FA using Yubikeys (or Yubico Auth TOTP) and removed any LP authenticator account, can I say I'm safe from hackers guessing my Master Password?  They could have the MP but they won't have the Yubikeys.</p>
