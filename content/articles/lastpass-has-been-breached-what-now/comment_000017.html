<p>Hi. After the breach I changed my Lastpass Master password (it was a sentence at over 35 characters) changed all passwords withing the vault at each website, as well as recovery codes, upped the iterations (it was at the original 100,100 now at 300,100). In my settings I used 2FA, and limited access from only 2 countries. How safe am I right now?
Also, I did keep copies of some documents in my vault. This worries me more than passwords, as all my sites have 2FA enabled since always plus all passwords have been changed.
Does the data that was breached only contain what was in there at the time of the breach or will they also have access to new data?
Anything else I can do other than deleting my account? Thank you.
Jose</p>
