<p>AVG is complaining about serasearchtop[.]com whenever I close an instance of the Edge browser. But I checked the extensions on it and I don't have the PDF Toolbox installed there, nor on my Chrome browser. Though I may have had it in the past. Or perhaps this script inserter is also connected to some other browser tool?</p>
