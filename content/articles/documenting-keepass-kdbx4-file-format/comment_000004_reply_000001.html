<p>Thank you for pointing me to this discussion. Now I have confirmation that people indeed considered data deserialization to be a major performance factor. There are no numbers given, and I wonder whether anyone measured those. To me, even looking into it for an application that does Argon2 key derivation is mind-boggling.</p>
