<p>Congratulations on this, which I just tripped across. I have just re-activated work on my <a href="https://github.com/jorabin/KeePassJava2" rel="nofollow">Java port of KeePass</a> (as a headless database).</p>
<p>Regarding documentation, I made a <a href="https://github.com/jorabin/KeePassJava2/blob/master/KdbxDiagram.svg" rel="nofollow">diagram</a> illustrating KDBX 3 and 4 and a couple of XSDs <a href="https://github.com/jorabin/KeePassJava2/blob/master/KDBX.3.1.xsd" rel="nofollow">3.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jorabin/KeePassJava2/blob/master/KDBX.4.xsd" rel="nofollow">4</a>. </p>
<p>As you note, the folks at KeePassXC have also done much solid work on <a href="https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-specs" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>. Wonder if they are interested in updating their existing work? I'd be willing to help. Key point in all this is that Dominik Reichl would need to be on board with such an effort and as you mention, hasn't been all that interested for a very long time - and you know, well, it's his project and that's his prerogative!</p>
