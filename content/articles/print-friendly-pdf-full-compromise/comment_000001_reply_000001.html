<p>The issues described here are resolved in the current version for Firefox (3.2.0). Most importantly, the extension no longer relaxes Content Security Policy protection. I can still see some rather questionable choices however, so I wouldnâ€™t expect this extension to be free of either security or privacy issues.</p>
