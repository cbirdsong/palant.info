<p>Thanks for the articles on this topic Wladimir, and raising awareness! Your research is really appreciated. </p>
<p>These malpractices, that some Korean banks are forcing onto their customers is really concerning. In order to access their bank accounts, the clients must install several applications (of questionable backgrounds). </p>
<p>Basically, they are undermining the security of the device, as well invading and violating privacy of the users. Installing certificates, forcing users to use legacy Internet Explorer, installing keyloggers, IP sniffers, opening ports, deploying fake antivirus and whatnot. </p>
<p>All of those apps that you listed above appear to be concerning. I do hope that law enforcement and independent/international auditing companies will eventually investigate this.</p>
