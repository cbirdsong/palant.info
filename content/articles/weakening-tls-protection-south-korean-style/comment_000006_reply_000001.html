<p>Uninstall is fairly straightforward when using a proper installer. However, the applications I’ve seen often don’t. There are self-extracting executable archives, there are really weird custom-made solutions, all kinds of things. There are even applications dropping parts into the Windows system directory like it was common in the Windows 9x era. And then uninstall of course has to be implemented and kept in sync with the installation manually. That it doesn’t always work isn’t surprising.</p>
