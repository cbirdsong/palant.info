<p>With all the discussion about the shortcomings of their encryption (besides all the other), I keep coming back to one question related to the encryption involving one's password. And I probably should have wondered this before, but how can any data that requires my password for decryption be shared with others at all? if "supersecretpassword" is encrypted with "myvaultpassword" and I share it with somebody else within LastPass, it somehow needs to be decrypted at some point and likely re-encrypted with the other persons vault password. Wouldn't there need to be some sort of gap? And not just with LastPass, but with any service that claims that there's "no way" to decrypt credentials without a user's password...</p>
