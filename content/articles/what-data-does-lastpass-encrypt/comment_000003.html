<p>Thank you for this article. As a longtime LastPass user, the latest news was unsettling. I dumped my data following your instructions and took a very careful look. I found that username/id, passwords, account names, account numbers, and especially the notes (extra) were all encrypted. I did searches on specific sensitive data, and literally inspected every page, and found no sensitive data that was in plaintext. On the other hand, all of the URLs were in hex, which to my mind is not encrypted; this for me is a lower priority, as my browsing history is collected by everybody these days, as evidenced by instant ads for something I just started searching for. I was considering changing password managers, but do not plan to at this point. It has prompted me, however, to change my master password (which has 2FA protection also), and to review my most sensitive data and ensure it is as secure as possible; strong passwords and 2FA, etc. Thanks again for this article; it was most useful.</p>
