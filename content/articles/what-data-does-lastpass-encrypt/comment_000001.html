<p>Completely unacceptable. I might have missed the fine print somewhere, but the only reason I put my trust in LastPass and give them a monthly fee is because I trusted them when they told me my data was encrypted with a password they don't know. Had I known all my URLs were not encrypted, I would have never used their service. </p>
<p>I was always skeptical about keeping my sensitive data on public clouds since I don't know what I'm doing and assume security companies know how to properly safeguard my data. But it is now apparent that they don't either, and at least if I do it I can make sure that everything is properly encrypted.</p>
