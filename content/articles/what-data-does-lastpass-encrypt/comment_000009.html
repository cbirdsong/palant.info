<p>Looking back thru your articles on LastPass and Bitwarden. What does MFA add to the mix? If I have MFA enabled does it really provide any additional security against someone compromising my vault? If they guess my password, aren't they still prevented from accessing the data without the MFA token/code?
Thanks!</p>
