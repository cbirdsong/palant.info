<p>If someone does move to another product like Bitwarden, how do commoners like myself know it's not going to have glaring issues like Lastpass in a month or year, etc.? </p>
<p>I did my "due diligence" before I chose Lastpass and didn't find these issues popping up in security blogs or such. Wondering how I minimize choosing a product that has glaring issues like unencrypted URLs - that's a horrible failing.</p>
