<p>It's a disaster. Anyone on lastpass needs to leave it. I am, and am making the migration to another.
Here's the rub. Whatever data you had on lastpass WILL get revealed. It's now only a matter of time. Maybe tomorrow, maybe a year from now, or maybe 10. But it WILL get revealed. If you stored SSNs, credit cards, addresses, drivers licenses, debt pins, and those pesky security questions (what's your fathers middle name), they are going to eventually be accessible to hackers and scammers. You can no longer use these answers for security questions, else fear another will be able to reset your passwords. Your personal life details, when stored in LastPass, no longer belongs to you. 
But wait, there's more. Since URLs for saved passwords were not encrypted, you can expect some serious, finely targeted phishing attacks like you've never seen. They already know where you bank now. Where you shop. They know every site you had passwords for. So as of yesterday, you need to become an expert at identifying scams and be super paranoid.
This is truly a security disaster of epic proportions. Lawsuits should and will come. LastPass is dead. The worst of this all is the lack of transparency. If LP had any respect for it's consumers, it would have been telling you this upfront. It would be recommending you change all of your passwords NOW and updating any information you had stored in LastPass (cancel your CCs and get new ones; redo security questions with answers you've never saved in LP), etc. This is a complete and utter failure on the part of LP, and is incredibly disconcerting. Trust is 100% lost. They should not be given the benefit of the doubt at this point. 
Good luck out there. You're going to need it.</p>
