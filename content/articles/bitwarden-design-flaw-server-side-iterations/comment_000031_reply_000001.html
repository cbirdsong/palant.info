<p>Presumably, you mean <code>guesses_log10</code> value. Yes, that value being 18 translates into 4.6 diceware words (5 dice used, meaning 7776 words in the dictionary). A five words password would definitely be better, already because zxcvbn cannot detect all the patterns in your password, so 10^18 guesses should be considered the upper limit of your passwordâ€™s complexity. A five word diceware password on the other hand will definitely require more than 10^19 guesses.</p>
