<p>Following up on my pwd equivalency, I've just checked the tool that you've recommended and it ended up with 18 guesses, so an equivalency of 4.5 dice words. So, using 5 dice words would end up being a better option. Hmm, gotta think this through, but I may switch my Bitwarden to 5 dice words. </p>
<p>Did I get my assessment right? Not sure if the 18 chars if my pwd ending up as the guesses was just a coincidence, or if I've done something wrong.</p>
