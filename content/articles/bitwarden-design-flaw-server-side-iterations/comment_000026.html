<p>I signed up on the website.  After playing with the website for a few hours I downloaded the Android app and started using it.  I logged out of all instances, changed the iterations, then relogged in on my devices/browsers.  I have no reason to believe my password was compromised. Thanks for confirming I'm safe</p>
