<p>I've been using Bitwarden since 2019, after seeing this article today, I logged onto the web vault and I saw that my KDF iterations were set to a horrendous 100k. Thank you for illuminating this problem and the solution. I've set it to 600k now. My master password is fine I think, although I will take a closer look soon.</p>
