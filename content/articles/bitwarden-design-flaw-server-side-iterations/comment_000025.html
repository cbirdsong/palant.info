<p>I signed up for Bitwarden about 0400 UTC on 1/26/2023.  My account used only 100,000 iterations so them saying it was fixed on Monday is incorrect.  When changing to 600,000 iterations should I also rotate the symmetric encryption key so vault data will be re-encrypted?  Do both steps need to happen to make the iterations more secure?</p>
