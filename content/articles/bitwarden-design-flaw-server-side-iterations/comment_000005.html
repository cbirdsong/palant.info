<p>Well, what you say is not essentially correct as well.</p>
<p>100,000 iterations on client side and 100,000 iterations on server side still means, 200,000 iterations are needed. If attacker gets the data and tries to guess the password using bitwarden servers, 100,000 on server side will slow him down as well. And there will be ratelimit to prevent DDoS attack.
If attacker has the data, he can brute force combinations, he will still have to use 200,000 iterations for that.</p>
<p>Please do some research before posting such material.</p>
<p>No affiliated with bitwarden in anyway.</p>
