<p>The whole usage of PBKDF2 is questionable, and I have voiced that opinion consistently. I don't mind 100k PBKDF2 itself, because PBKDF2 is a joke, given what we know nowadays about bitcoin mining. We have extremely efficient ASICs that can hammer SHA256 very easily and produce PBKDF2 with brute-force in no time. I have no doubts that there are specialized chips and hardware out there to brute-force PBKDF2. It's not hard at all to design your own circuits around available ASICs chips.</p>
<p>Why don't these companies use Argon2 or similar hash functions is beyond me. There are implementations for Argon2 on all platforms nowadays.</p>
