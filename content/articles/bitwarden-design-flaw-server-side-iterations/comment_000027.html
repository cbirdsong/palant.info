<p>hi, thanks for posting this very relevant info. I have recently spent hours and hours repairing the damage caused by the LastPass debacle. Ain't taking no chances with BW (might move on to 1Password though because of their secret key) and set my iterations to the max level of a whopping 2.000.000 combined with a ridiculous password of 921 bits.  </p>
