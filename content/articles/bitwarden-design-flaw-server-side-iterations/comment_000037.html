<p>Bitwarden latest update Feb 2023, included Argon2Id support as follows : "By default, Bitwarden is set to allocate 64 MiB of memory, iterate over it 3 times, and do so across 4 threads. These defaults are above current OWASP recommendations"</p>
<p>OWASP recommendation : "Use Argon2id with a minimum configuration of 19 MiB of memory, an iteration count of 2, and 1 degree of parallelism."</p>
<p>Do you think, default Bitwarden Argon2id would be sufficient with strong 5 letter random passphrase (Even random that of Diceware / EFF list) ?</p>
