<p>"Even if you configure your account with 1,000,000 iterations, a compromised Bitwarden server can always tell the client to apply merely 5,000 PBKDF2 iterations to the master password before sending it to the server."</p>
<p>I'm confused, so what's the advantage of increasing the KDF iterations from our account settings?</p>
<p>Or is this in case of a compromised Bitwarden server that is modified to always tell the client to apply merely 5,000 PBKDF2 iterations to the master password before sending it to the server?</p>
