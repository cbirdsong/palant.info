You can modify the depth of interrogation: see TZP [1] or the main creepJS test [2]. Even at full depth, any "false positives" are simply an extra fingerprint: e.g. it can distinguish Opera from Chrome. Works on Firefox, not just Chromium. Try something like Cydec or even just a simple user agent switcher and test on TZP (just click the lies to output to console)</p>
