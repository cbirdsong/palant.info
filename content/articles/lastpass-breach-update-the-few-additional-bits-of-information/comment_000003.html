<p>Have some sympathy for those of us who were convinced to sign up with the firm in early September. Why there hasn't been a class action lawsuit yet is utterly beyond me. 33 million customers. They had ONE JOB. They knew they were compromised and were actively taking on new customers throughout that period. I know because I was one of them, and they didn't even have the decency to offer a refund, after announcing only 2 months later that they'd lost everything. Beyond furious. And am I right in thinking that we still don't know about this business of storing URLs and other personally identifiable data in fucking plaintext? To my mind, that's arguably worse than losing the passwords, and will probably lead to some people dead or persecuted by their governments. Great job, guys.</p>
