<p>I'm wondering if former LastPass users who deleted their accounts before August 20, 2022 are truly in the clear. I understand that the data was "dated" August 20th, but does that mean only accounts that were active on that date are impacted? LastPass clearly says that any account created after September 16th isn't impacted but they say nothing about accounts deleted before August 20th. My LastPass account was deleted in early August, before August 14th, and the deletion email states "Your LastPass account has been permanently deleted and all of your data has been purged from our systems." Regardless, I rotated all of my passwords in December in my new password manager.</p>
