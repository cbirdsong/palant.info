<p>I'll give you another reason... using CAs not part of the standard distributions can often be a pain in the neck. </p>
<p>So many software development tools these days involve reaching out to online repos and data sources of some kind, and making sure <em>all</em> of them recognise the MitM certificates is practically impossible. So every time I hit new certificate problems in a tool, I just log a job with the IT team to whitelist the site... and the speed with which those requests get approved suggests that they don't like it either.</p>
<p>Of course, the same is true of legitimate corporate CAs too... but tools needing to hit internal sites seem much rarer than those wanting internet access...</p>
