<p>Very interesting find! I'm currently working on a project where I try to detect reputation manipulation in the Chrome store and construct clusters of extensions with similar patterns of seemingly faked or incentivized reviews. 16 out of 18 of the extensions you mentioned are flagged in my project as suspected targets of reputation manipulation; when tracing back through the clusters created of the said 16 extensions, another 40 extensions are flagged for having similar suspected reputation manipulation, indicating the same group or individual is behind the action.</p>
