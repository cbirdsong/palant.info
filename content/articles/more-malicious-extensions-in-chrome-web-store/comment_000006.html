<p>Maybe you can write a small extension for Chrome that will look at the names of installed extensions in the browser and, if it is on your list of malicious ones, warn the user about it with a brief description (for example, tracks user actions, opens hidden tabs to cheat visits, and so on)?
And then the user himself decides to delete the extension or not.</p>
