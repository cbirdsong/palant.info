<p>Thanks for your interesting article (and the other ones too!). I noticed the same things in extensions. I also discovered two plugins which inserted malicious code on facebook, pinterest and other social media websites, that sends stuff back to 'home'. Another plugin had become a giant affiliate-tracker, which rewrote urls of a bunch a of ecommerce sites to include their own affiliatecode to make money. I believe this last one was a screenshot extension. 
I also contacted Google multiple times through multiple channels, but there was no reply whatsoever. 
Only when I replied to a warning-email about one of my own extensions (I had to update my privacy policy) I finally got a human response. Then I addressed the issue that I found on the screenshot extension. Finally, after emailing a bit, they even took the extension offline. 
So there actually are some employees who care about the users, but it seems that the formal channels to report something are not (very actively) monitored or responded too.</p>
