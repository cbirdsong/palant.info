<p>Hello, thank you for this detailed review. I'm not sure if you have info and recommendations for Mac users, though, but would be appreciative if you could comment. I've been using the free version of Avast Security, but would prefer not to help the company monetize my data without my express permission. I tried the free Avira software, but unfortunately had to choose one or the other due to incompatibility issues, so I stuck with the devil I know. 
Should I switch back to Avira for Mac (free)? The following article was detailed but ultimately assumed a higher familiarity with antivirus software than I possess: https://cybernews.com/best-antivirus-software/avira-vs-avast/
I'd be thankful for your take.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
