<p>One of the perks of Edge browser is that its easy to convert Chrome extension into Edge. So our malicious translator plugin works there too - mdbngpgblembhpfoinlmpadondopfhlf :) By the way Google is notoriously known for ignoring extension removal requests. Working for an AV company doesnt seem to have any special effect too. I gave up reporting mal. extensions to them a long time ago. 
Kudos to your work by the way, browser JS is often a f*** mess.</p>
