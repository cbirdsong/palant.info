<p>I’m mostly finding them accidentally, just like you. I do scrape Chrome Web Store occasionally however, so I have manifests of &gt;50k extensions, allowing me to search for unusual patterns (see <a href="https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/palant/chrome-extension-manifests-dataset</a>). I also have a database locally with the text of ~1,600 extensions, allowing me to search for any code patterns. In particular, that background proxy in the malicious extension you found: it’s also present in <code>igkkmokkmlbkkgdnkkancbonkbbmkioc</code> and <code>lopnbnfpjmgpbppclhclehhgafnifija</code>.</p>
