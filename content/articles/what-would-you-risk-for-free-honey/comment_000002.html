<p>How would you recommend using honey?(cause i still want to use it XD) Personally, i only activate honey myself before paying and deactivate it immediately after i have the discount codes. In this way honey couldn't actually steal any data other than which product i would buy or am i misunderstanding this? Because in my eyes this personal data would be worth the 5-10 â‚¬ that I save again and again with honey</p>
<p>Or do you know some other tricks to stop those risks?</p>
