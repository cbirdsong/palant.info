<p>Thank you for the article üôè</p>
<p>As you mentioned, those applications are old and poorly maintained. It is irony that those security applications are <strong>NOT</strong> secure. In reality, we found that those applications are possible path to harm security. For example, we found Windows buffer overflow occurred when we open some Windows setting menu in special conditions with some applications. I disclosed to the companies and they do not care about the problem. As result, my work place use VMs for accessing banking and government websites.</p>
