<p>There's a program that detect and remove those "fake security programs".
Some of us (because I am South Korean.) use them frequently because they cause performance issue.
Glad that you'd noticed this.</p>
<p>Side note: This security only works for Windows. If you are using Linux or MAC OS, You have to format to Windows. Plus, those security programs detect whether the system is running on VM or not. At least they expended to chrome extensions but most functions are exclusive to Windows.</p>
