<p>Thanks for highlighting this major issue in SK. Been struggling with it in the past 10 years as an IT professional here.
Additionally to the problem created by those "security" software, we should add that in order to install them (sometime to use them), users needs admin rights on the computer.
Many companies are giving user admin rights on their machine because of this, and this add another level of insecurity to their systems.</p>
