<p>In my opinion the problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Policy
Policies force banks to operate client-side security solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bank
There are security people who don't know security. They select a solution based solely on the price of the solution, the availability of the solution, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security Solution Corp
According to the policy, the bank has to pay for the security solution, and the security solution company delivers the solution and that's it. They don't care about security. They are also not interested in the well-being of their employees. The key staff consists of juniors who have just learned computers. When they gain experience, they go to bigger companies due to lower pay. And then new juniors come in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to change this is to change the policy first. Trying to handle everything in security on the client-side is a very stupid policy.</p>
<p>Separately, many competent security experts in Korea have pointed out this problem, but the stupid policy has never changed.</p>
<p>This article you posted has another ripple effect in Korea, and I hope there will be a change in policy this time.</p>
