<p>Well, drat. The ultimate open secret of Korean web is finally being revealed in English.</p>
<p>As an academic security researcher in Korea, the situation was barely optimistic since we were holding a World Cup tournament in our homeland, and after IE’s deprecation the situation became even worse. </p>
<p>Honestly? I gave up about online banking or e-govs, but the remnants of those silly things still loom on most AMD64 Windows-based Korean net games. Or even retail games (cue DJMAX RESPECT). Many of us get pissed off when we have to turn off the Windows feature called Core Isolation just because we installed one.</p>
<p>I don’t think the men in black will ever listen to you, but at least I am hoping for a more hostile atmosphere to build up. They will finally submit when no one decides to use either Android or Windows, on which those *cough*security*cough* lurk on.</p>
<p>Cheers for your effort.</p>
