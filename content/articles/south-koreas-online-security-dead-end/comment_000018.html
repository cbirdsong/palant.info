<p>Financial Supervisory Service(FSS) made this situation.</p>
<p>FSS asked financial companies that their customers MUST have some security controls which typical browsers do not provide, for example KrCert, anti-virus/anti-keylogger on the client side. FSS revised the regulation and those bogus applications are not mandatory these days, however, the companies learned that they can avoid their responsibilities with those boguses when a security incident occurs.</p>
<p>FSS also asked companies to separate all of their environment from the internet even "dev environments". Only some of outdated libraries will be given to developers, and they had to develop applications on their own without the internet. Even security updates are NOT ALLOWED if it is downloaded from the internet because FSS thinks opening ports is not safe. This is why companies are still using C and old libraries.</p>
