<p>It really is about time they do something about it. Last time those banking websites were full of IE activeX stuff. As far as I know, since that caused tremendous discomfort for many people(not only a security hole, but also pain in the ass to use). There was a legislative action to ban activeX. Yet it was not enough to banish the 'security application' altogether, the bank websites now ship 'cross-platform' security applications which I feel dubious about the security it provides, just as you explained here. Even as a citizen, I do not know how to go about it. Hope your disclosures actually has an impact(alas a big one), or else SK is just risking everyone's data. Thanks for writing this.</p>
