<p>Ah, yes. I’ve been reporting these issues via KrCERT. It’s… an interesting experience. :-)</p>
<p>Largely futile unfortunately. I’m not sure these companies are interested in fixing these issues or capable of doing it. The first deadline was two days ago, the company didn’t fix anything but it also didn’t contact me about it. I hate doing this, but it seems that I’m publishing zero-day vulnerabilities next Monday – I don’t see any other way.</p>
