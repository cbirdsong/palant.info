<p>This reminds me of Russia's situation.
It started in mostly same way.
Special apps which should be running and bank's site will communicate.
It was even worse. Banking is regulated industry and Russia's Federal Security Service decided you either do crypt per USSR's standards or their derivates or it's not consider strong crypto even if it is. Russian cryptographic standards are just different and not supported by regular browser even today. Oops.</p>
<p>But after some time passed, this was changed to consider USA's cryptography as good enough for regular clients and not require any special programs. Russia's Central bank and FSB just started to listen to common sense.</p>
