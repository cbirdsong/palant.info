<p>Thank you for your impressive articles.</p>
<p>Please understand that the content is delivered through a translator because of the lack of expertise and poor English. I also add that this is just my personal argument.</p>
<p>I generally agree with the general point. Korean software focuses on 'customers'. This 'customer' is not the end consumer, but the 'enterprise' that provides the service. That's why cloud adoption is slow. Korea's IT system always requires customization.</p>
<p>In that respect, the fact that cybersecurity products protect "banks" rather than "financial consumers" accurately sees the situation in Korea. Korea is a country that imposes very strong regulations on companies. Rather than "to prevent information leakage," companies find ways to "put the responsibility on consumers even if there is information leakage."</p>
<p>Cybersecurity solutions in the financial sector are used to attribute information leakage to "consumer's responsibility, not mine." For example, if a consumer's smartphone or PC is infected with malicious code and a security accident occurs using financial services, the bank can avoid responsibility, saying, "You did something wrong."</p>
<p>Not all cybersecurity in Korea is like this. Giant companies like Samsung Electronics use solutions from globally proven companies such as McAfee, CrowdStrike, Spunk, and Paloalto Networks. What's particularly problematic is the public and the finance. Surprisingly, Korea has been banned from using the cloud in the financial sector until recently. It has a particularly closed environment.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity companies say they can't help it. They provide 'customized services' to specific customers. It's not an environment where you buy a good product on your own. That's why what you call a 'fake security solution market' is formed.</p>
<p>I wonder if what you're looking at is based on a PC like Microsoft's Window or Apple's MacOS. Or are you looking at the mobile and judging it together.</p>
<p>I think the Korean financial industry has almost abandoned the finance of the PC environment. We're developing everything mainly on mobile, so Android. In the Android environment, security applications are provided in the form of APIs, so you can use financial services with one financial app. It's in stark contrast to the PC environment.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just my perception, and I don't know if it's accurate information. And in the case of iOS, I'm not sure because I'm an Android user. I have heard several times that it is very difficult to use financial services in MacOS or iOS in Korea.</p>
<p>I look forward to your comments being meaningful. Thank you.</p>
