<p># THANK YOU!</p>
<p>As a privacy-minded South Korean, I absolutely <strong>hate</strong> South Korean internet banking with its "security" plug-ins (and don't even get me started on Naver and KakaoTalk...). </p>
<p>I really hope your posts gain traction and that the current South Korean security "infrastructure" will burn to the ground, as unlikely as it is due to all the institutional and historical inertia.</p>
<p>Thank you for doing god's work.</p>
