<p>I agree with some of the parts you wrote.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two major problems with Korean online security.</p>
<p>## 1. Old Legacy</p>
<p>As you said, this is a chronic problem. Korea has maintained this by using ActiveX and traditional libraries, although online financial services have come out faster than other countries.</p>
<p>Of course, recently, Internet banks such as Toss and KakaoBank have appeared and are changing rapidly, but this is the second problem.</p>
<p>## 2. Limitations of outsourced development</p>
<p>I worked for a Korean financial company until a few years ago. But they offer services that complicate both users and financial firms under the guise of security. I thought at first that this was a matter of policy.</p>
<p>However, policy is only a trigger for these issues, and most importantly, continuous development is not carried out. And many problems were found that the responsibility was transferred to development through outsourced developers and maintenance was not properly performed.</p>
<p>I think there is a difference in why Internet banks have grown so fast. They operate with their own development system and structure. It's not a way to build a castle on the sand, it's a whole new way.</p>
<p>Of course, Internet banks are not necessarily the best, but they are definitely changing the Korean online security market with a positive impact.</p>

<p>Your article is raising the alarm on Korean online security. Thank you so much for writing this. I'll also look forward to the next episode. However, Korea is getting better. It's still uncomfortable, but the direction itself looks right. </p>
<p>It sometimes takes a lot of time, power, and luck to change not only policy, but also corporate culture, technology, and security awareness. Please write such echoing comments often. Thank you.</p>
