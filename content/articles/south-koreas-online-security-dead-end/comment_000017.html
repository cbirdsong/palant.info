<p>I have stumbled across your blog entry because somebody in the Korean community abbreviated+trnaslated your points as a dark humor. 
As a Korean all of your observations are more than correct unfortunately. 
I'm afraid the installing "security" apps over all these years left Korean people far too vulnerable and left a habit of install programs brain-deadly if a website asks you too. As you mentioned this has become a real security risk with hackers compromising said program's distribution programs' download source, making phising webites to operate far too easily. 
This goes beyond computers, some apps request to download their APK files to install the "full version" of their apps on some Android apps(or worse, pretend to be the full version), and non-tech savvy people just blind slightes take their word for it due to the active-x and npapi downloading culture the Korean companies have created over the decades. 
It is now mostly non-required for important government websites to install plugins, but some minor government branch will still request you to download weird to understand apps (like a seperate print preview+printing program). 
I'm afraid the 90 days you gave those security companies can be just wasted, as a) they'll probably be aware of all the issues you have probably raised and b) because conservative Korean companies view security as a waste of money and they know this and just exploit them. 
More over, even large companies/banks in Korea try to cut corners in costs and outsource their cyber security personnel (a famous accident like https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13263888.am. this or https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/south-korea-television-and-banks-hacked-fingers-pointed-at-north-korea this, which they just blaimed North Korea for a clear security breach done by outsourced personnels)
Anyway loved your insight and I sincerely hope that those companies did their due-deligence</p>
