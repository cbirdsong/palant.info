<p>great catch. for the victim in the above thread, you should do whatever you think is necessary. To Wladimir, I'd advise you against giving advice even though you are well qualified. This will basically open your up to lawsuits if this person finds himself/herself hacked and life's savings lost because you told them everything is OK. For your protection. Be safe.</p>
