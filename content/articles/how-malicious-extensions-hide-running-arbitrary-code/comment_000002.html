<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yesterday I received a notification within Google Chrome to alert me about a malicious extension (listed in your previous article).
I have been using the extension for only 10 days and during this period of time, I have never experienced a redirection of google search and have not noticed any suspicious behavior. I guess that the program was collecting data as you explained.
I'm a bit worried and would like to ask for advice about needed actions. Ofc, I have deleted the extension but I'm wondering if any malicious code is still there? In which case, should I unsintall Google chrome? format my PC? I'm also resetting the sensitive passwords which I used during this period and I'm even wondering if I should not block my credit card (ofc used as well when the extension was there :D). 
Apparently, Avast is still investigating on how harmful all this is but I'm not sure they will make real progress as the code is injected and not visible for them.</p>
<p>Thanks for your work and thank you in advance for the advices</p>
