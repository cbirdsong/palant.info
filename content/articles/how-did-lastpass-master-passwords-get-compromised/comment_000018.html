<p>I have used Google Authenticator since I started using LastPass. I can not in any way log in without it. And my Master Password is completely unique with 19 characters, upper and lower case, numbers and a special character. Thing two chemical formula combined but those formula don't exist.</p>
<p>That should be safe right?</p>
<p>I'm more interested in Google's relatively new Password Manager (at least on Android, it's something shared between Chrome and Wallet, and one can add a shortcut to the Launcher since it's a standalone activity, but not an app, probably one in Google Play Services then). To add: You can enable "On-device encryption", and considering the Help page from Google here, is that something you'd recommend? https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/11350823</p>
