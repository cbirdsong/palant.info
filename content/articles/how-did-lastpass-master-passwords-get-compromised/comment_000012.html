<p>I spoke with the proxy IP provider that I found in the email from lastpass after doing a whois from the IP. I explained them the situation before lastpass even made their first statement. 
They answered that they blocked the user who tried to access my account. I am not sure if this is true or they just responded like that to make me believe they took action. But if this is true then we might have a confirmed attack?</p>
