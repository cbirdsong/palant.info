<p>Why are you assuming that the hash just contains the password? It probably is combined with the users Mac address or another identification from the device to make the hash, as an example. Then lastpass can prompt that you have never logged from that device and make you authenticate the log in. Then they store the location and Mac address etc. The hacker could not get ahold of passwords from lastpass and create a hash or use an existing hash. They will not have enough information.  This article is just instilling fear into people. Don't simplify the process, it's more complicated and you know it.</p>
