<p>I got the same email headed "Login attempt activity blocked...". I don't remember having a login failure and I haven't been blocked, and I always use a VPN to access it on my phone (only one attempt from a PC of which they talked about switching and I declined). There is no info on where the attempt came from, but LastPass did recommend to change my master password if it wasn't me. My master password is 21 characters so surely brute force from my end is not possible, most likely something was got from LastPass IF there was a breach.  Good piece I must add, but we still don't know unfortunately.</p>
