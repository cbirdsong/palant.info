<p>First of all, I am not a nativ english speaking person nor particular tech-savvy so I might have misunderstood this.
When I use my browser to log into my lastpass account and then open lastpass.com/getaccts.php I get a set of data with (I assume) all my account data. Its encryptet. All values like username etc are just long strings of lower-case letters and numbers. But contrary as statet in the above blog post also the URL is encrypted like this.
Just a few minutes ago I changed my masterpassword. So I don't know if the url was plain text when it was encrypted with my old masterpassword.
Could it be possible that the assumption in the blog post is correct and in response lastpass also started to encrypt the URL when choosing a masterpassword?</p>
