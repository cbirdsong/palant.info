<p>I wish I saw this earlier.</p>
<p>I logged into my cryptocurrency wallet on Thursday and over $100,000 of coins had been transferred out on December 26th. I thought it was the wallet app, but after finding this I know it was Lastpass.</p>
<p>I looked on the account activity and there was a login from United Kingdom that was not mine that was still logged in!!! I closed it all down and changed my master pass, but I can see on the Lastpass account history, they logged into every single exchange where I have an account. They had the time to go through all the secure notes and find the coded saved screenshot of the 12 words and then found the password and recreated the exodus wallet and accessed like it was theirs.</p>
<p>I've been going over everything on my end and finding no security threats on my local machines. I always use a VPN and I even used coded titles for my secure notes....they've had access to my account long enough to pour over every single thing--all of my identity docs, social security, bank accounts, birth certificates.</p>
<p>I've filed a report with the FBI but of course, I can't get anyone from lastpass to talk to me about anything.</p>
