<p>Since the password should never reach the server, is it possible that the captured hash could be used to decrypt the database? Or is a separate hash and/or a different browser-side salt used for that purpose? Even if the latter is true, the page receiving the hash for unlocking the password file could theoretically have been compromised as well.</p>
