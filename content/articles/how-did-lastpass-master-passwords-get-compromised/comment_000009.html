I actually did this to myself, and had a panicky few minutes before I figured out it was me.
I went shopping on a global Amazon EU site to see what was available to Europeans and not to Northern Ireland even though still in the EU customs union (the answer - a LOT!). I then tried to use LastPass for my Amazon password, no go.
It was several hours later that I got the email, by which time I'd initially forgotten I'd even tried to log on whilst VPNed into an EU country</p>
