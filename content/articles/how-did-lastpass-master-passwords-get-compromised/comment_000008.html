<p>Thank you for a well written article that is intelligible even to a non technical person like me. I have used LastPass for a long time, and therefore, am very interested in keeping up with any security issues related to LastPass. I use Google authenticator for MFA. I sure hope that is enough to keep my account safe from hacking. I don't know what else to do, or whether any other password manager is any less vulnerable than LastPass</p>
