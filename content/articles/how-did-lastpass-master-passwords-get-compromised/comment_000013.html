<p>When I look at all the "information" you have here, NONE of the scenarios you've outlined explains it all. Nothing explains everything that users have reported. So, I really think your tl;dr is unjustified.</p>
<p>If the purpose here is to gather hashes and bruteforce the master password, why the repeated "successful" login attempts?</p>
<p>Why are new accounts, which presumably have nothing valuable in them also "successfully" logged into? If this is a real hack, isn't the new account phenomenon a pretty strong indication that this isn't just a LastPass thing, but is also related to something these individuals have done?</p>
<p>OR: How's this for a scenario that both seems plausible and would explain what's been reported: There is indeed something wrong with the email alert system at LastPass. The "likely" that LastPass added to their announcement should be interpreted as "we aren't yet sure this bug explains everything that's been observed," rather than "we are just making this up because we have no idea what is going on."</p>
<p>And that you just insist on preferring the second interpretation for your own selfish reasons?</p>
