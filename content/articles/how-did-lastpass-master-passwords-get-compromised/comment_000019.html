<p>Thanks. I also changed my LastPass iterations, which were at 100100 to 500500 and and it took only seconds so IDK why they need until June for all users? I have plenty many sites and notes there. And restricted any login attempt to 4 countries. No one from Brazil can even try (seems a little amateur to not VPN in, and they can if they find my country, but it's a useful setting). Regarding people having difficulties remembering hard completely random passwords with all the recommendations (lower/upper/random/really to "non-existing chemical long formula that I got wrong in the beginning of chemistry and special characters", it's never been for me. But hey, I've been a Linux user since 11 years old. It's in my muscle memory. I was bedridden 2 years and after that I had some problems with some, but muscle memory kicked in. I even remembered some hefty difficult passwords at the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (LAN facing servers but important enough).</p>
<p>Thanks I will encrypt my Google Password Manager passwords on my phone. I don't, and absolutely do NO recommend syncing passwords between devices, no matter browser, as you use different sites on different devices! People MUST stop doing that. When signing in to a new installation or account in Chrome it does ask to enable sync and a link to settings with something like "Click here to manage what you sync". Can't imagine who syncs extentions and themes and such. Extensions for example, do not sync your settings for that extension so why? And I use 2 factor on EVERY service offering it, luckily more and more and usually now an offer at creating a new account. But otherwise I check old accounts on important services and see that they've added it so I enable it. That'll just eliminate the possibility of logging in even if they crack a password.</p>
<p>I have VERY different sites stored in Chrome on my phone compared to my workstation (there I almost exclusively use LastPass, except non-important sites, but tend to migrate them slowly but surely. As a monster PC both size and spec wise is physically safe as well. And the password to the admin account.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is there, recently upgraded because Insider and Dev Channel, with an 8 digit PIN, which is supposed to be better according to Windows. It won't stop bogging you before you've set up "Windows Hello". However that is a clean installation with nothing important on it. Maybe booted 1-2 times per 6 months.</p>
<p>I have another accot for Steam with a pretty easy password, if people know my GF, but no one will like stand there because someone's here if any stranger is too. That account can't do anything important really, but runs all the games perfectly on my TV on a mediocre 6600 XT. Beats Windows on DirectX 11/12 Ultimate at any game I've benchmarked. Incredible this dxvk and vk3d to Vulkan. I'm not a gamer but I like benchmarking and some games but then with my GF. And using controllers from the couch with 5.1 surround (that also works in all Windows games having it, all AAA).</p>
<p>I thought about changing to 4-5 random words and have many totally ridiculous ones I would remember as that cartoon, however my 19 chars scored as good.</p>
<p>My 3 HDDs that holds my 10 TB of multimedia (not using all, yet), are encrypted with LUKSv2 so good luck anyone. Any authority comes and I unplug the PC. That's it.</p>
