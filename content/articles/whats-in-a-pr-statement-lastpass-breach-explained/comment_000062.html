<p>My account was set to 500 iterations, and I didn't have any idea about this setting until I saw their blog post. I was never notified about this most recent breach, and it was a clear dodge on LastPass' part to drop this 'update' on December 22 - the day before 1/2 the world will be out for Christmas.</p>
<p>I'm surprised they didn't wait until December 23, but they were off, too, and they didn't want to have to 'work' that day. </p>
<p>Their silence on this and the way they attempted to minimize it with a news drop says all I need to know about the people running LastPass. Whatever class action lawsuit they catch is well earned. Here's hoping they and LogMein go out of business as a result.</p>
