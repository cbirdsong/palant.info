<p>Thank you ffor this comprehensive summary.  I haven't found anywhere in the LastPass iOS app to check/adjust the iterations setting.  I have never accessed LastPass via the website.  Considering the LastPass breach and their apparently lax attitude regarding vulnerabilities, would accessing from the website add any risk exposure beyond what may have already occurred?</p>
