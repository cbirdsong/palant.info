<p>Fine. The precise problem with that xkcd comic is that it has promoted the cult of the passphrase amongst people like your previous commenter Randy (who I did name in my original comment) who are out of their depth. They will argue at length that "correct horse battery staple" is a better password than an 8 character random string, despite the fact that it actually contains 8 bits less entropy. Or they'll suggest "piglet was one cute little dude" as a good example of a passphrase despite the fact that is considerably less secure and more predictable than a truly random passphrase. Or they'll mix up dictionaries and character sets and proudly announce they can create 3000^31 31 character passwords.
Worse still, Randy and the xkcd 936 cult have infested the Web, bamboozling those without the desire or capacity to learn about password entropy and good security. Their jargon filled rants have the veneer of credibility to the layman, who follow the 936'ers into a security panacea that will crumble into dust as soon as malicious actors notice there is an opportunity to exploit their poor passphrase choices.</p>
