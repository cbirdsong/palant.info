<p>Thank you for breaking this SHIT-SHOW of a notice for me. I received a letter from LastPass a month or two ago and because of HOW it was worded, I didn’t pay much attention to it mainly because it stated, and I am putting it into what MY understand of the letter said, is that I had NOTHING to worry about and the chance that any of my data more than likely was safe. WHAT A LOAD OF WORD SALAD that came from them. They only stayed in the letter that it was a “third party” that was breached but NEVER said which one. Google? Samsung? Apple? Knowing who was breached would be a wonderful thing to know. Now, I am getting notifications CONSTANTLY that my passwords have been found on the DARK WEB ! ! ! And now I am getting unauthorized charges on my debit/credit cards and over the limit free for some and cannot make my payment on other accounts because of the missing money… Sad thing is, I DEFINITELY do NOT make a bunch of money and whoever is doing this crap is purchasing stuff from sites like Wal-Mart that I would normally not pay attention to and are making them for around the same amounts of my usual purchases. Between LastPass data breach this year AND T-Mobile’s last data breach… NONE of my ANYTHING is safe and EVERYTHING a scammer needs to access whatever they need/want because ALL my info including my SSN is now on the Dark Web…</p>
