<p>LastPass states that business customers using Federation are better off due to the use of a “hidden master password” which requires 2 separate strings that must be combined in order to decrypt a vault. One string is stored in the company’s identity provider and the other string is stored with LastPass (they claim this component wasn’t compromised). So in addition to compromising an Associate’s master password, an attacker would also need to compromise both of the randomly generated strings stored in those 2 different locations. Should we trust LastPass when they state that these companies are at a significantly lower risk because of this architecture?</p>
