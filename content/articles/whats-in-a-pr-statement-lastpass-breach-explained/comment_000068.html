<p>Thank you so much for this useful article.  I checked and my iterations was still at 50,000. I've bumped this up to 310,000.  I was considering migrating to 1Password with their use of a secret code (in addition to the masterpassword) to encrypt all our passwords stored on their system. However I notice you had mentioned in one of your replies that: "So far the only solution that I looked into and could actually recommend was 1Password. However, a security researcher I very much respect is highly dissatisfied with their vulnerability handling."</p>
<p>Is there an article from the security researcher about why he/she is dissatisfied and what concerns they had.</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
