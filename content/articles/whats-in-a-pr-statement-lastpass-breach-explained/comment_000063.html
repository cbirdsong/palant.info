<p>Came here via digg.com. Thank you so so much for this article which finally nudged me to delete my account. I had been with LastPass for what feels like ages. 10 years maybe? I was aware that there had been at least one security breach in the past but the corporate PR back then made me believe that it had not been that serious. But this now and your commentary is the straw that broke the camelâ€™s back. Invested the last 2 weeks deleting my 150+ LastPass entries and manually assigning new passwords to each one of them. Finally done and realised that I need to this more often.</p>
