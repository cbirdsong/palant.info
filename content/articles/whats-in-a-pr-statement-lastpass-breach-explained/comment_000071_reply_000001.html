<p>Well, LastPass <em>could</em> force all users with a weak master password to reset it when they log in. They <em>choose</em> not to however.</p>
<p>I just tried again and – yes, my eight-character password still works. I can log in, and I’m not forced to choose a new password.</p>
<p>There is a red dot on “Security Dashboard” now however. When I go there I see a message on the right side:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Master password alert
February 27, 2023</p>
<p>Master password strength
Weak (50%)</p>
<p>For your protection, change your master password immediately!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not ideal of course: it relies on the user noticing the red dot, reading the message and taking action. But that’s at least something.</p>
