<p>Is there any reference or mention by LastPass in any of their terms and agreements or documentation as to which fields they do and do not encrypt? Advertising "AES256 Encryption" rather than "AES256 Encryption<em>", "</em> does not include URLs and these other fields..." is misleading at best.</p>
<p>I am also curious about the impact to clients of LastPass Authenticator which can also be backed up to I assume the same cloud and location as the password vault but haven't seen any mentioned of?</p>
