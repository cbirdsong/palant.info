<p>hi, thanks a bunch for your article, it's great even though the contents are disturbing to me. Reading it, together with the reactions and other articles on the internet a few questions keep lingering for me:</p>
<p><em>how many accounts are breached in total?
</em>how can a user find out if his/her accounts are among them?
*which editable fields in each users'database are in plain text? (I understand the url's are plain text, which is already insane, but are also the fields in which a user could jot down notes plain text?)</p>
<p>Lastpass ought to give more information about the breach. More information not limited to but including answers to questions above and questions raised in your article and reactions to it. Gimme a break.</p>
<p>Regards, Priko</p>
