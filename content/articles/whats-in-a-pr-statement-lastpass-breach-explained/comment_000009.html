<p>I was wondering if you have any opinions about the super-admin user capabilities and password recovery...</p>
<p>Because lastpass website says super-admin can reset user master-passwords without losing data...

<p>Not to mention the master-passwords can apparently be recovered using SMS... (so is it possible to decrypt the vault data anyway?)

<p>It also says admin can view master-passwords. But I think it is a mistake in their article...
