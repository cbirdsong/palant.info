<p>Thanks for pointing out that one can change the number of iterations. However upon checking today, LastPass had updated mine to 100,100 and IIRC the Account Settings said it was their minimum. However I changed this to 500,500 and (you don't type in the comma) and it said it could take a while but took just a couple of seconds once the progress bar appeared.</p>
<p>As for IP addresses that's logical. Also, in if you click Advanced on the Account Settings' first tab, you can scroll down and set <em>Only allow logins from these countries</em>. Now that's nice. I just added my own of course, Norway, that was auto-checked, and well should I could end up in Sweden or Denmark temporarily, but the must have one is Spain as that's my second home. I hadn't revised that section "Security" (first tab Advanced mode) in a good while, and more options where there. Very basic geoip.</p>
<p>Also I in addition to using Google Authenticator mandatory, only letting my phone and workstation remember it for 30 days, plus my completely (yes) random 19 characters password, I'm good I think. Also I enabled LastPass's own Authenticator app. It's pretty sweet to use with LastPass. Of course I could swap Google Authenticator for that, but I'll probably just that one just for LastPass.</p>
<p>You wrote in another you hadn't tested the Android app (not iOS either?). I find it pretty good, and it doesn't push me to the website. That's only and absolutely only for the Account Settings I can end up there (from extension). It's a good idea to delete all "authorized" sessions and mobile devices, as they can pile up and some names are cryptic, and log in again on whatever device got logged out (all in this case). It got some URL settings there too, which IIRC first time (maaany years ago) I opened an account, was indeed prefilled with some URLs, and IIRC that tab is called "Never URLs".</p>
<p>The point about URL parameters is good, and I've always said to peopleb "You know what you do when you've forgotten a password right? You tap the «Forgot password" button, get a unique link by email [today they all say the expire within X minutes, also SMS confirmations], and therefore your email is DEFINITELY your weakest link. Someone can access that, and they can reset all your passwords!!». Pretty much anyone, even tech savvy people get a little «oh shit never thought about that! or how drastically important my email account is» Usually, unless they've added SMS confirmation too, or something else (Google uses a range of options and not always can you use this or that backup option if you can't log in to that Gmail you use purely for testing).</p>
<p>So TLDR: Don't be logged into your email on anything not properly secured. Like it's fine on my workstation, it's always in sight an locked if not, and my phone, which well, is very secured. Otherwise, none. No authorization to macOS for example. Add a Google account there and it wants access. Just see the prompt of permissions, or later in Google My Account &gt; Security which should be revised regularly, in fact if you use Google account creation for some non-important service, some apps only allows Google, Apple, Facebook (!?) etc, but the point is, those normally only ask for your email, and possibly name and whatever you yourself have made public in About Me on My Account.</p>
<p>DO: Such apps where it offers "Continue with Google" and only asks for e.g. your email, they just read it and create an account on their system, and no longer uses Google for anything, not storing anything in Google One/Drive, it was just to get a username for you, SO, you can REVOKE permissions to such apps. You won't get logged out then, as they only have read permissions. You reinstall the app later and just "log in" (continue) with Google (or Apple etc), and your saved data is there. Like my Football ("Soccer") app, the highest ranked in the world even made here in my city in Norway. Benign data which leagues, teams etc I follow. Same I guess with Feedly which took completely over RSS when Google Reader was shut down (remember that? so many were sad on Reddit), and Feedly only (or did) accepts such logins, via Google, Apple and 1-2 more. Just to create the account and save your feeds and preferences on their own system, so revoked ASAP after "logging in" when app is reinstalled on a new device.</p>
