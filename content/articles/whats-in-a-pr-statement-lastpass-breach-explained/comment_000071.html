<p>Wow, awesome write up on the LastPass breach! Very informative!</p>
<p>I had a question about this part of the article:</p>
<p>"If you are a LastPass customer, chances are that you are completely unaware of this requirement. That’s because LastPass didn’t ask existing customers to change their master password. I had my test account since 2018, and even today I can log in with my eight-character password without any warnings or prompts to change it."</p>
<p>This is just incredible. Why can't LastPass just force a password reset of all their customers who have the weak 8-character master passwords?</p>
<p>Also, are you still able to log in with your 8-digit password? </p>
<p>This just boggles the mind...thanks again for the article, it was an eye-opener!</p>
