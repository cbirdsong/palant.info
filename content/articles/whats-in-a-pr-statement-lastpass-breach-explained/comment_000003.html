<p>Thank you for this great summary. I got very similar "vibes" from it but this breaks it down in a very succinct and clear way. </p>
<p>I've had a LastPass account for a long time and was very surprised to see that my account was still at 5,000 iterations; I am someone who absolutely would have changed this if warned and was able to find it and change it once I was aware of it. I also thought based on their defaults that 100,100 was sufficient; thank you for alerting me to that being wrong as well.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate because it's such a hassle, but I've got to move myself and my family off of LastPass ASAP.</p>
