<p>Not terrible, and some fair comments towards the end on user base management, consistency in upgrading users and enforcing good practice. </p>
<p>My only gripe is the analytical leaps made early on interpreting the PR releases. This is sort of ok, but if you where writing this as an actual intelligence product, you need to clearly identify analyst opinion from facts. You also give a rational and level of confidence to a an assumption or connection made. </p>
<p>The reason it bothers me so much, is I see people re-post articles like this as facts. And it’s like a cascade, those with less in-depth security knowledge, can’t identify opinions and facts and these semi-truths become the story.</p>
