<p>Thank you for the informative piece. Can you please confirm that I am correct that:</p>
<p>a) the attacker(s) possess the email address used to login to the vault.
b) the attacker(s) possess the URL of all websites for which the username and password are stored.
c) the attacker(s) possess the encrypted master password to the vault.</p>
<p>d) The attackers do not have the username and password of any website but can obtain these if they manage to decrypt the master password.</p>
<p>If the client chose a easy to brute force password then it's game over for them. If they chose something with far more entropy then they will hopefully be OK.</p>
<p>Also, as you pointed out, if they known a password is stored for a crypto-currency website for example then they can send phishing emails from that site (since they have the email used to login to the vault).</p>
<p>Yes?</p>
