<p>I already have to correct this slightly however: check your <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/how-do-i-change-my-password-iterations-for-lastpass" rel="nofollow">iterations count</a>. If it’s set to 5000, the effort of decrypting your data is much lower and you might get targeted after all. Note that a long password isn’t always a safe password, particularly if it is made up of dictionary words or something similarly predictable.</p>
<p>Also, the more time passes, the more likely it is even for those “unattractive” vaults to be decrypted. You should keep that in mind and at some point change the password at least for the valuable accounts (online banking, shopping websites). For most people there is no urgency, it’s just better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>The only other precaution I can think of is: expect phishing emails. They now know where you have your accounts. They might attempt to trick you into giving away your LastPass password, and they might do the same with the other services you use.</p>
