<p>The worst part is that URLs are unencrypted and the attacker knows the matching of vaults with previously leaked emails. Without this information, this leak would have been many times less useful. Master passwords can be cracked, yes, but it also takes time and resources (GPU, CPU, electricity, time, etc.). If you have hundreds of thousands of encrypted vaults, it is an exercise in futility to try to decrypt all of them in the hope that some of them contain anything interesting. But the attacker has websites, so they can, for example, target only people who have a PayPal account or something similar, or target business accounts. An absolutely incompetent password manager solution.</p>
