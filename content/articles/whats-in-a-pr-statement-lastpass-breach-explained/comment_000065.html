<p>Great article - thanks for writing.  Many articles on this breach don't really get into any details about the risks and what to do about it and so I appreciate that you took the time to explain the LastPass statement and get into some detail.  The typical recommendations seem to be to "change all your passwords" and get a new password manager, but the former can be easier said than done and the latter does not negate the existing risks to comprised data which may include sensitive data in secure notes, and bank and credit card entries.  These are things that cannot be easily changed such as bank account and routing numbers, credit card numbers, etc.  Also, with nearly 900 passwords stored over 20+ years of using the internet, deleting now defunct Web sites and changing passwords for those still in existence could take about 40 hours or so by my calculations. If LastPass were more responsible, they would provide their customers better guidance and, ideally, some tools to help manage and minimize risks.  For example, something as simple as helping to identify and prioritize sites by risk level (e.g. financial at the top, forums at the bottom) and ability to see when passwords were last changed relative to the date of the breach would be extremely helpful to help manage through this. But I have seen neither the guidance nor any tools from LastPass which is why I now agree with many who say it is time to change providers.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any thoughts you may have on Microsoft Authenticator as a password manager.</p>
