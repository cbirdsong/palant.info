<p>Two things I was unaware of here:</p>
<ol>
<li>LastPass didn't encrypt URLs.</li>
<li>LastPass backed up our vaults to a 3rd party cloud storage provider (that's what I interpret from the statement)</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason I used a PW manager in the first place instead of something like KeepPass stored on DropBox is because I didn't trust even an encrypted vault sitting in a cloud. But LP is doing exactly the same thing, except that now they are a high-priority target! And the fact that the URLS were not encrypted is unforgivable. Maybe they mentioned it somewhere, but I didn't see it. When they keep saying "zero-trust" and my data is fully encrypted, I trusted them. It is not okay that all my URLs are now public for everyone to peruse. It's not just a security issue, it's one of privacy. The fact that all my URLs are stored in plain text completely shattered all the trust I had in them.</p>
