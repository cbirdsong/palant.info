<p>Concerning 1: Presumably, this backup copy exists in case of data loss in LastPass’ production environment. Supposedly, it was an “encrypted container,” so it shouldn’t matter whether it is stored with a third party. Unless LastPass loses the encryption keys of this container, which they did.</p>
<p>Concerning 2: Yes, 2FA sadly no longer helps protect that data. The attackers already have a copy, they no longer need to log in.</p>
