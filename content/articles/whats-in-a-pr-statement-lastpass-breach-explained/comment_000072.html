<p>I'm still digging into this article, and have another question:</p>
<p>So LastPass stores both the passwords and the metadata (URLs, IP addresses, user's name, email addresses, etc.) in the customers vault.  However, the passwords inside the vault are encrypted but the metadata is not?  So EVERYTHING is in the vault, but not everything is encrypted?</p>
<p>If that's the case, this means that all the metadata is already visible to the threat actors, even though the passwords are safe (but only if the customer has a strong master password).  Do I have this correct?</p>
<p>Also...isn't it the standard to encrypt everything, including metadata? I don't understand why LastPass puts everything in the vault but does not encrypt the metadata too?</p>
