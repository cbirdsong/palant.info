<p>LastPass did not blame the users, that's your own personal prejudice coming out. LastPass said that if you followed thier advice your in good shape. That means that if you didn't follow their advice you need to act quickly. That is reasonable advice, it isn't saying it's your fault that your password was cracked.</p>
<p>That said, a user who has been taught good password hygiene and refuse to use it are 100% at fault for making it easier to crack their password, just as LastPass is not at fault for being hacked, they didn't do some things that made it harder to breach their systems. Te criminal is ALWAYS at fault. </p>
<p>To say that most users can't remember a long complex password is flat out wrong. Bad password advice by trusted "security experts" is a huge part of the problem. </p>
<p>How hard is it to remember "piglet was one cute little dude"? </p>
<p>Please encrypt that passphrase with LP's algorithm, assume you know that I use a passphrase, but you do not know the number of words or which words. Now go crack it. I don't want theory, I want outcome.</p>
<p>It won't fall to a dictionary attack based on found compromised passwords. What about a password/passphrase token attack? How big is your dictionary? Is piglet in it? When you tell me how many words are in your dictionary, are you counting capital letters? do your iterations count all caps? First letter of each word capitalized?
Without knowing if the user is using a passphrase are you going to start with a lengthy password token attack or spin your wheels using other methods of password cracking?</p>
<p>Let's say that you have 3000 words in your dictionary. for a 31 lowercase character password you have 3000^31 possible permutations. Are you going to tell me that it isn't stronger than "xR$8(p#wb0K~"</p>
<p>I advise people to <em>make up</em> silly sentences that have at least 20-characters.</p>
<p>As for the different types of encryption, what's the effective security difference between an octillion permutations and a decillion permutations of a given length and character set.</p>
<p>If one technology only protects my password for a million years, and another for a trillion years, bitching about the use of the lessor technology is snobbery.</p>
<p>So, what's the difference in maximum time required to crack a "piglet was one cute little dude" password using the different technologies. I say maximum because absolute time depends upon a variety of factors. For example, if an attacker wants to brute force a password sequentially, knowing that most LP passwords are at least 12  their going to start with (95^12) - (95^11) permutations of the character set. That means my 13-character password, aaaaaaaaaaaa will not fall until a very, very long time. See, just one extra character made all the difference in the world. Granted, an un-optimized sequential brute force attack is likely to be the last resort.</p>
<p>By the time you are using a 20-character or greater password, the use of multi-character set passwords becomes substantially meaningless unless you're a very high-value target.</p>
<p>Security "experts" that keep espousing icorrect and/or obsolete password advice do play a role in users not using better passwords. Unless allowed password lengths are less than 12-characters, 12, not 8, should be the recommended minimum password length. For a PW manager master password users need to be taught that a minimum of 16 characters should be used and that a 20-character minimum is highly recommended. Of course password hygiene needs to be taught too. </p>
<p>Users do not need to remember long complex passwords, then need to be taught how to make secure, long, and easy to remember passwords. Even at that, "Piglet was one cute little dude1!" meets 4-character set complexity and is good enough to last through most anything but a phishing attack, keystroke logger, lucky guess, or side-channel attack. But then encryption doesn't make much difference. </p>
<p>Teaching that most users can't remember a long complex password is incompetent. Teach how to make long memorable passwords with instruction concerning things like always make up your own sentence and mind the character count.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's the criminal's fault. Yeah, LastPass could have made it harder to get breached. Yes, customers who deliberately ignore best practices are to blame for making it easier to crack their passwords, but poor quality security education has exasperated the problem, and many refuse to learn how to give better advice.</p>
<p>As for quantum computing, when it is mature enough to matter, will any of the algorithms you mention much matter? There is research underway that is trying to create counter-measures to protect against quantum attacks on cryptographic technologies. </p>
<p>As a complete aside, you might find this article interesting. Note that I didn't create the title. The title is bullshit. There are no security consequences since, according to an ML expert, algorithm that exploits the concept would take too long to run.</p>
