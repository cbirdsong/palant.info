<p>Asa LP user for over 10 years, this one hurts. I have recommended LP to friends, family and more recently clients and to now have to unravel that is not only an inconvenience but a hit to my reputation as a cyber security SME. I've already changed most of my most sensitive passwords and  transitioned to 1Password and will be advising other to do the same, even though LP will probably, hopefully, (maybe?) fix their glaring security issues. I won't stick around to find out. </p>
<p>Two questions that I have regarding this is: 1: why was there a backup copy of my vault on a third-party storage solution? What purpose does it serve? And 2: If had 2-FA enabled on my account, does that mitigate the potential cracking of vault or is it rendered moot because it's apparently an offline copy? I hope they're able to answer these questions.</p>
