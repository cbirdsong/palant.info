<p>Thanks for working through the PR fluff and breaking it all down. As a LP customer hoping you can help with some question:
1 - My master password is 17 characters - should I be worried at this time - assume I am not a high value target , just a regular person 
2 - Now that the horse has left the barn , besides changing all of my passwords (big pain) and leaving LP , is there anything else to be done ?</p>
