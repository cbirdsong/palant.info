<p>Hello, in the comments above you said:</p>
<p>"LastPass 2FA has nothing to do with encryption. It’s merely an additional step when you log in, so that you can access the vault data. Given that the attackers here got the vault data already, they don’t need to care about 2FA any more."</p>
<p>I have a Yubikey on my Lastpass account. Does this mean my vault data is any more protected?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
