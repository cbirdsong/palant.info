<p>Yes, the 2015 breach has already been massively downplayed by LastPass. Back then they got away with it. Maybe the perpetrators just didn’t know what to do with the data, or maybe they also believed the LastPass narrative of the data being properly protected, or maybe the resulting fallout merely wasn’t attributed to LastPass. Who knows… But there has been significant research after that breach demonstrating that the data is everything but properly protected. That LastPass is still telling people “it’s encrypted, so nothing to worry about” when they should definitely know better – that’s negligence.</p>
