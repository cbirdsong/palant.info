<p>I've been a LastPass user for six years. Not sure when they changed the iterations requirement but mine is set to 100100. Even if no one wants my data because I'm a nobody :), I am still switching to something else. As a freelancer, I have a lot of passwords stored. I notified all my clients to let them know of the breach, and to recommend that they change their passwords, especially for accounts to which I had access to financial information. Also, LastPass's data export process is absolutely garbage. My husband was flabbergasted -- exporting LastPass data resulted in all my data being displayed in a new browser tab window with no encryption when it was supposed to generate a CSV download.</p>
