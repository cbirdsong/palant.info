<p>Thank you for this timely information.  I have been a LastPass user for a very long time and I was concerned by the breach.  When I got the second notification I reviewed my settings.  My account was set to 100,100 itinerations and I have 2 factor turned on.  I first heard about LastPass from the podcast Security Now and decided to use it per the host vetting of it in the early days.  I also knew to reset itineration from 5,000 to 100,100 and enable 2FA from recommendation of Steve Gibson, one of the podcast hosts.</p>
<p>It is a daunting task to move because of the number of passwords stored and that most of them are long generated passwords I can't possibly remember.  I always set master password to 12+ characters of all types but in a way I can remember it.  My main concern about moving to new password manager is I don't want to migrate to a worst one.</p>
