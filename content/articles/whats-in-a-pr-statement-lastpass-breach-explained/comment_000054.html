<p>Thanks for this great info. Something I haven't been able to find the answer to is this - is the email address of the vault i.e. the Lastpass username unencrypted with/in the vault? Or is it encrypted along with all the other password usernames? So is the only way for an attacker to identify the email address of the vault to unencrypt it? (Or figure it out from IP address and URLs in the vault.) Thank you again.</p>
