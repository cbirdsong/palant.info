<p>If a user is going to be using passwords that fall to a dictionary attack, no encryption in the world will help them. While I don't blame the user for a breach, users have to accept some responsibility in their security too. If you're a high value target and your password isn't at least 30 characters, you aren't doing your part to help with your own security. </p>
<p>That the law requires some degree of transparency is insufficient to say there is no commitment otherwise. There is a strong personal bent to this article. You do not differentiate between lies and updated information that was not previously known.</p>
<p>What you don't know is if other such companies have been breached, which has happened or will happen, and how well their vaults will stand up to offline attacks.</p>
<p>Not saying that there weren't some serous problems, but your post does make some assumptions that would appear to be unqualified unless you have inside information</p>
