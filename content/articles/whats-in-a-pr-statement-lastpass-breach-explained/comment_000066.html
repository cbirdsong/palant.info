<p>Thanks for this detailed writeup.  </p>
<p>The question I have is about the encryption of the stolen vaults. I understand from the LP blog entry and your analysis that the storage container encryption keys were leaked, but I thought customer vaults were encrypted using an encryption key generated from (a 1-way salted hash of your master password + account name) x nn PBKDF2-SHA256 rounds. </p>
<p>If the encryption keys acquired by the actors were storage container keys and not the keys used to encrypt the data, how could simply brute forcing / guessing a master password password be used to decrypt the leaked vaults?  </p>
<p>Maybe another way to ask this:  is my limited understanding correct, and did the threat actor also obtain the vault encryption keys?  (Please reference if you have one - I'm super curious). </p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
