<p>Thank you for the easier to understand translation of the LP message. I have been a long time user of LP, have multi factor authentication but don't know if that means anything.  I'm not knowledgeable obviously and need direction on how to find what iteration I have, please. It seems overwhelming to change all my passwords but will start right away with crucial banking and anything financial and go from there. Sad that you can't trust anything these days!</p>
