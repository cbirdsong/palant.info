<p>Thank you for your detailed analysis and explanation.
Do you perhaps know if our 3rd party 2FA keys are also compromised? Hope I have explained that correctly. They store them in their vault for our “convenience”. I think I will finally leave them, but while I find my next password manager, do we need to redo all our 2FA’s. I.e disable and re-enable? Thanks</p>
