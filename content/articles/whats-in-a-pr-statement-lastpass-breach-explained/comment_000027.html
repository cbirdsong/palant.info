<p>I disagree with OWASP idea of setting iterations to 310,000 iterations.
Personally I know the importance of master password, so if a user like me sets his password to 30+ characters (I am fast typer),
then 1 iteration of KDF should have no problem for me.</p>
<p>I am a Keepass user, according to the link I linked, the time per action of your Keepass database
should be set to 0.1 seconds or less, so the user feels the computer is responding to his/her request instantly. This way Keepass will feel fluent to use, just like LastPass.</p>
