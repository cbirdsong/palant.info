<p>"They will argue at length that "correct horse battery staple" is a better password than an 8 character random string, despite the fact that it actually contains 8 bits less entropy"</p>
<p>This seems to assume that there is 11 entropy per word, but this is only true as per the xkcd example, and even if we assume this is using Diceware's website, the wordlist is now 7776 words meaning you have 12.9 entropy per word which is only 1 bit less entropy than a random 8 character password that uses a-z+A-Z+0-9+special chars, and more importantly as has been said, who can remember a totally random password of 8 chars vs a string of words (not to mention that you can use your own words not present in Dicewares dictionary or capitialize letters and end up with loads more entropy than a easy-to-forget random string of characters). </p>
<p>Sure a random string of letters at say 18+ characters is what I use for each secure site I have saved in my password manager and probably easier-to-type for the low security ones but for the MASTER password on a password manager where you should not write it down anywhere then it's hard to argue that a 8 character totally random password is better than a diceware-esqe password format - for most people. Guaranteed that if you try to get an older person to remember their password thats totally random - first thing that they will do is write it down and leave it lying around. Me personally, I don't use a diceware password as my master password but neither is it totally random to me either. It has over 100 bits of entropy and isn't using plain character substitution either so it would be hard to guess using any sort of dictionary-with-substitution attacks.</p>
