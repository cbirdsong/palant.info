<p>Your comment would come across better if you could explain what’s wrong with this comic. I don’t know what “3000^31” is supposed to mean and where you got it from.</p>
<p>This comic is actually a pretty good representation of real password complexity, as opposed to supposed complexity based on password length and character set which is still quoted way too often. And it explains nicely why diceware passwords tend to be considerably more secure than anything people can come up with normally.</p>
