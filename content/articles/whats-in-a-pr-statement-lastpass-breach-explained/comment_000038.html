<p>Thank you for taking apart this great example of deflection. While you cover mostly <em>what</em> they say, or leave out, I wanted to add emphasis to how they say it. Use of the words "third party... service" tries to trick people into thinking "it wasn't lastpass' fault". Same for "if you[...] do[...] not ... make use of the defaults" -- like it would have been a user's choice <em>when</em> they signed (&lt; or &gt; 2018).</p>
