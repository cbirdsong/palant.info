<p>Thanks for the informative article. I followed the instructions in the LastPass email to check the number of iterations, and discovered that mine was also set to 1 (one). This is the first time I was even aware of this setting, which is hidden unless you enable Advanced Settings. </p>
<p>Additionally, my master password was still 8 characters -- my fault, but never flagged as insecure by LastPass. </p>
<p>Based on these two weaknesses, I'm assuming all my passwords were compromised by this leak. Time to change passwords and password manager.</p>
