<p>Hi Wladimir - one more question which relates to me trying to think of a new master passwork which i would like to create using a 4-word (14 chars) random dictionary passphrase + 10 chars from my old master password which are pretty random and have letter, numbers, symbols. I want to keep that bit of the old one as its muscle memory and would create a lot of entropy on top of the passphrase.</p>
<p>Embarrassing newbie question - Assume my LP master password is cracked and my vault is opened - how does the hacker <em>actually</em> know they have cracked it? I mean they will just see the random passwordsput there in the first place. What is the sign to them that they have opened the door so to speak.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
