<p>My password had 59.54 bits of entropy (10 characters long, upper, lower case letters and numbers) and I had (from the very beginning) set the iteration number to over 150000. Should I still be concerned?
Also how does the salt affect the brute force speed? Does the fact that it is known what the salt is for each user make it irrelevant?</p>
