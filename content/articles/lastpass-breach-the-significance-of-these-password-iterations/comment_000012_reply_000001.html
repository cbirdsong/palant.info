<p>A high iterations setting is mostly an issue with smartphones. Back in 2018 I had to convince LastPass that smartphones don’t have any trouble dealing with 100k iterations. Now it’s almost five years later, the hardware improved. So my guess is that logging in on your smartphone won’t take too long even with 300k iterations. But you can test it, changing it back is always possible.</p>
