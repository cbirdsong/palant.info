<p>It's a combination of a couple of passwords that were sent to me when I was registering for a site.  Both of them looked pretty random to me, but I don't know how they were generated.  I plugged it in on two different entropy calculators and came up with the same 82 bits of entropy you mentioned.  Based on this information does that help you determine if my password is safe enough, or pretty easy to guess?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
