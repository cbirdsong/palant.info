<p>Congrats for your blog, is really full of great stuff.  It's a shame I discovered it under unfortunate circumstances.</p>
<p>I've been following the LastPass incident as I'm a former user, now I'm migrated to 1Password. It's so much better, sadly I did not migrate 1 year ago. I'm really interested in security and would like to learn more and test stuff.</p>
<p>Where can I find tools to test my security?
I don't want to input my password in a website, so, is there an offline tool to test password strenght?
How can I check how in risk I am, considering LP had my vault configured for 5000 iterations.</p>
<p>Now I have a better strategy, passwords in 1Password, OTPs in Yubico Authenticator only for those sites where a Yubikey is not supported and has top security priority, and for the rest of sites Aegis OTP.</p>
