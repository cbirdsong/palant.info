<p>Great work, thank you. Read all comments and replies so will only ask one unanswered question.. Have Lastpass now updated everyone's number of iterations?</p>
<p>I checked mine today and saw its 100,100 but am worried (as a long time user) that it was previously lower and they updated everyone in the last few days.</p>
<p>If not, it might be relevant that I upgraded to Premium in Oct 2022 (was free for 10 years prior) and that upgrade triggerred the iteration upgrade? If so, do we know when the user vaults were stolen - was this the August attack?</p>
<p>Lastly - if the account details (unencrypted) were stolen won't that make it easier to reverse engineer the master password. Eg John Doe is likely to have johndoe@gmail.com as username and hackers can see how that was encrypted to then find matches in the passwords.</p>
<p>Really last, do we know if the notes field in each password entry was encrypted. Presume many use this to store things like hints, recovery codes, old passwords etc</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
