<p>According to their latest breach update they have, yet again, changed their position on iterations. Conveniently the KB article on their website, that recommended setting 100100 as the iterations has very recently been replaced with a new article that recommends a setting of 600000.</p>
<p>the latest breach update is here:

<p>The KB article regarding iterations is here (conveniently without a published date):

<p>Yet another example of how LastPass are throwing dust over their litany of negligence and incompetence that led them and us to all be burnt.</p>
<p>Now I have to ensure all my clients are checking and increasing what their previous default was of 5000 (that they still hadn't pushed out to their older clients - something I discovered over the last month when contacting some of my older cliets to find them still set with 5000 iterations), to ensure they were on their newer and still inadequate setting of 100100, to ensure they're all now on 60000!</p>
