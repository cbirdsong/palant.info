<p>Did LastPass ever detail how long they store vault archives via their third-party cloud provider? I would normally assume that old archives are purged regularly, but apparently nothing can be safely assumed with LastPass. I ask because even if LastPass updated iteration counts, encrypted additional fields, etc, older archives would not contain those security improvements, remaining vulnerable to the weaknesses of LastPass' older standards. And since users are notoriously terrible at updating passwords unless forced, an older vault may be as useful to a malicious actor as an updated version.</p>
