<p>Holy Moly, I have a headache just reading this stuff! </p>
<p>Wladimir, are you saying that our login password is weak if it is not computer generated? If so, how are we supposed to remember a long, random password? I use a long password that can be remembered but is combined with special characters and the like. Is that sufficient? If not, I guess I need to go back to writing my passwords on a pad of paper and keeping it in my safe. :-(</p>
<p>Great stuff here, Wladimir! Really great stuff. Thanks!</p>
