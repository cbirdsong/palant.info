<p>If your password is truly random (computer-generated), you have 82 bits of entropy. So if you take the numbers in the table for 50 bit passwords, you need to multiply them with 2³² (roughly 4 billion). That would be safe enough.</p>
<p>If on the other hand this password only <em>looks</em> random but hasn’t been generated in a random fashion, guessing it should be pretty easy.</p>
