<p>No, I don’t know any specifics of the implementation here. However, you have to expect shared folders to be compromised if <em>any</em> of the accounts with access to them is compromised. That obviously includes super admins, but also regular users these folders have been shared with.</p>
<p>Also, the vaults of super admins are clearly high-value targets in general, with them having access to passwords of all other users. While LastPass will normally only allow super admins to reset a user’s master password, in reality they of course hold the keys to the user’s vault. Otherwise resetting the master password without losing data wouldn’t have worked.</p>
