<p>Thanks Wladimir - appreciate your answers. Just unbelievable how bad this is. Hope I have a few weeks to update all my passwords and various keys.</p>
<p>My instinct is to side with companies and blame hackers but their failures are glaring. They fully deserve to lose customers. They won't even tell us when the data was stolen. I've seen there's a class action case starting in the US. I wonder if European users will start GDPR claims. Lastpass is probably finished. </p>
<p>I'm staggered they didn't hire you in 2018 to make LP the most secure system following your simple ideas. They're completely at fault and I have no sympathy at all.</p>
