<p>You could test your password on <a href="https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/" rel="nofollow">https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/</a> â€“ this is using the zxcvbn library on the client side, nothing is sent to the server. Alternatively you could download zxcvbn yourself and use it locally, assuming that you know a bit of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Note that zxcvbn only gives you a rough idea of password complexity. It will recognize some common patterns but not all of them.</p>
