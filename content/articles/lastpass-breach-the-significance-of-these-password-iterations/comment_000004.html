<p>Hi Wladimir,</p>
<p>Thanks for you blog posts. They have been very helpful.</p>
<p>Do you know anything about the server side PBKDF2 iterations LastPass perform?</p>
<p>Their support documentation states that there is some here: <a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/about-password-iterations-lp030027" rel="nofollow">"LastPass also performs a large number of rounds of PBKDF2 server-side."</a>.</p>
<p>I have not been able to find any documentation on the number of rounds. The support article mentions 100,100 but it is not clear if that refers to client or server side. I think it is probably the client side as they say "By default" in relation to that number.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the server side iterations had been applied to the stolen data as it was a backup. I think this could make a big difference to those that had a low number of iterations configured on their accounts if there are a high value of server side iterations.</p>
<p>Interested to know what you think.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kevin</p>
