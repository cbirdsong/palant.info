<p>There is one thing that I can't figure out from reading the LastPass blog statements... Did the hacker get access to the "Password Hint" client field data?
If so, things are much worse for those affected because the hint would hugely simplify the brute-force task in most situations.
Do you know anything about it?
Thanks!</p>
