<p>Hi - </p>
<p>So, 'pretty good' password; 13 characters, no dictionary words (derived from mnemonic phrase), no 'common substitutions', mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. But, if LastPass never updated iterations above 5000, still pretty much hosed if someone wants to dedicate resources to an attack?</p>
<p>What are your recommendations for extricating oneself from LastPass, given the horse has left the barn? Simply move elsewhere and ask them to delete your account? I'm seeing some folks suggesting that you keep a free account, but delete all the contents. Not sure this makes any sense...</p>
<p>Really appreciate what you're doing here; wish I'd seen your articles a year or two ago!</p>
