<p>I found mine set to just 5000 also. Free tier user, then Business level for years. I noticed the new recommended 600,000 on the LastPass Iteration page (its April 6, 2023). Honestly, people should move away from this platform. Don't mix personal and work accounts, ever. Thanks for the blog bringing this to everyone's attention.</p>
