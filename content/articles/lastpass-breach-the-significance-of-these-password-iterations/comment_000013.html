<p>Been a lastpass user for over a decade, started using it after Steve Gibson recommended it on his podcast years ago.  I have lots of data for me and my customers, much of it stored in Secure Notes.  Anyway, I went to check my Iterations.  It's set to 1 !!  Apparently it was never updated.  Maybe I'm reading it wrong.</p>
<p>My master password consist of 16 characters of random lower case letters and numbers, so I think that means 52 bits of entropy.  </p>
<p>How long do you think it would take to brute force it?  </p>
<p>I guess that only matters if my vault is selected.</p>
