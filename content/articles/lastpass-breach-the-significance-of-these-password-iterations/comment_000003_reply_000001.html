<p>You could try <a href="https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/" rel="nofollow">https://lowe.github.io/tryzxcvbn/</a> to get a rough idea of how hard your password would be to crack. guesses_log10 is the important value: for the 50 bit password used as example here it would be 15. One less than that means “factor 10 easier to bruteforce,” one more means “factor 10 harder to bruteforce.” Result should be taken with a grain of salt but it will give you an idea of the risk.</p>
<p>If you conclude being at risk, changing all your passwords would be the most important thing to do. Whether deleting the account or deleting contents makes more sense is unfortunately impossible to tell from the outside.</p>
