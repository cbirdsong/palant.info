<p>Thanks for your thorough and straightforward explanations of security. We use Shared Folders in LastPass Business. Are you aware how they are encrypted, i. e. are the passwords only encrypted with the super admin's master password? LastPass documentation states: "<a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/what-are-shared-folders" rel="nofollow">Users must generate sharing keys before being added to shared folders</a>".</p>
<p>I'm of course wondering whether, if any of our master passwords were broken, attackers would get access to the Shared Folder, or if it requires breaking the super admin's master password specifically.</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>
