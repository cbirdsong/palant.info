<p>I don’t think they’ve done anything. Changing iteration count isn’t trivial, it requires re-encrypting the vault and takes some time. So you should get some visible feedback after logging in. Also, someone reported receiving an email confirmation in 2019 about an automatic iterations upgrade. This part is optional of course, but presumably their system will clearly notify you about the change.</p>
<p>LastPass still didn’t communicate when the data was stolen. Somewhere between August and November, so far we don’t know any better. I just hope that their silence doesn’t mean that the attackers might still be in the system.</p>
<p>Username is known to the attackers, but this isn’t an issue. However, as the previous comment points out: master password hint is also unencrypted. And this one might make guessing the master password a lot easier.</p>
<p>Yes, the notes field is encrypted.</p>
