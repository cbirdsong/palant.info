<p>This is really hard to tell. If you had 100,100 iterations and a reasonably complicated password which wasn’t reused elsewhere – decrypting your passwords usually shouldn’t be worth the effort, and your biggest concern should be phishing emails.</p>
<p>There is one complication however. Whoever has this data, they are going to keep it. And in say five years the calculation might look entirely differently. Better hardware, different priorities, and suddenly your account might no longer be safe. So it’s a good idea to eventually change the passwords at least for the important accounts (anything tied to your identity like email, banking and shopping websites etc.).</p>
