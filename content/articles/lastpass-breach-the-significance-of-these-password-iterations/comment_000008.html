<p>Thank you for your post (and the previous ones), as a long time lastpass user I was shocked to see that my vault was still configured with 5000 iterations.</p>
<p>And perhaps more importantly, I didn't know about this setting and how critical it was before the breach.</p>
<p>I think I should be somewhat safe for now (I use a 32 character password mixing dictionary and "original" words with some numbers and uncommon symbols), but still, what a mess! I'll have to update at least the most critical accounts.</p>
