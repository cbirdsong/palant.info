<p>Hi - My LastPass iteration is at the default of 100100.  I was told by LastPass that if I increase the iterations then there's a risk that "some browsers may not be able to handle that and data within the vault could become corrupted."  Does that sound correct to you?  Also, have you heard about whether there's a good number to increase the iterations to and that won't actually cause corruption within the LastPass vault?  I spoke with someone at LastPass about this just now and they wouldn't give me any info on this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
