<p>Thank you for your writing on this. Wish I had a better reason to find your site. I just logged into my Lastpass account and my iterations were set to 100,100 and I changed them to 310,000 based on what I read here. </p>
<p>If I may ask for your recommendation: I had changed my LastPass master password about 30 days ago, and have always used a master password that's 14+ characters, mix of caps, lowercase, numbers, and special chars. Would you still recommend changing my passwords saved in LP and the master PW again now? Ditching entirely? </p>
<p>It seems like no cloud PW managers are a good solution or much better than any other.
Thanks again!</p>
