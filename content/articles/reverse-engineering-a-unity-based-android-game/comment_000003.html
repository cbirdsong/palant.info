<p>Hello, thank you for the very thorough article, I ran into an issue with the APK I was trying to decompile. If anyone perhaps knows what I could do to fix it, I would really appreciate any and all advice, thank you!</p>
<p>I was able to successfully decompile the APK using both methods mentioned in the article. However, I was unable to find the Assembly-CSharp.dll, or the libil2cpp.so files. I was able to find the global-metadata.dat file, and that seemed to be readable by IL2CPPInspector, however I could not find the binary file that actually contained the data. I looked for every extension I could think of (exe, dll, so, out, bin) to no avail, and I was kind of stumped. I looked around the entire output of the decompilation, and I was not able to find anything that seemed useful, not even a linux mapping .txt file. I know the project was made in Unity, and it seems like it was compiled with ProGuard enabled. Could it be possible that my decompilation was only partially successful? If not, is there possibly an alternative way of packaging these APK's that I could possibly be missing? I figured that because I was able to find the "global-metadata.dat" file, I needed to find a "libil2cpp.so" counterpart, but I am stumped. Thanks!</p>
