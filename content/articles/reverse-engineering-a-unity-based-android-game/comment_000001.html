<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm interesting on your point of view of security of mobile games created from Unity.</p>
<p>If my understood from your analysis is correct, you could retrieve some information, but not everything as it is 
relatively confusing translated from what it was originally designed in C# and in the end you had to guess quite often, right?</p>
<p>Also, this particular case did not seem to be obfuscated anyhow. Could you manage to look into hardcoded values for the variables within the functions?</p>
<p>Regards!</p>
