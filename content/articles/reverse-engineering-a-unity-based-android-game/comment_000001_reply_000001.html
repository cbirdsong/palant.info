<p>This is not about security but only obfuscation. As the C# code is compiled, understanding it becomes more complicated than usual decompilable .NET code, but still way easier than compiled C++ or the like. So if the goal was obfuscation, this clearly isnâ€™t sufficient. I think that there are solutions for additional obfuscation but none have been used here.</p>
