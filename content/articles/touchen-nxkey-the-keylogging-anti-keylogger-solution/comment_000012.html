<p>Many thanks from Korea. Please keep going. This has been a well-known massive problem since the internet banking was introduced in Korea. It is really sad that this is still happening, and doesn't seem to be changed in any soon. It's been a long time that banks, security software makers, and the government formed a big cartel of bogus security. Just hoping your work will make a crack on it, so one day the cartel will collapse.
By the way, there is even a program called 'Hoax Eliminator' (구라제거기 in Korean), which removes such 'security program' easily and cleanly by one click (https://teus.me/862). An individual, who just sick of such security programs, made this. Since the security program is installed on the system, and make the system slow, and makes bunch of mess even when we don't use the internet banking, usually we install the security program only when we use internet banking, and use the Hoax Eliminator to remove them. Funny.. and what a non-sense.
Thank you so much again, and hope you have a great happy new year!</p>
