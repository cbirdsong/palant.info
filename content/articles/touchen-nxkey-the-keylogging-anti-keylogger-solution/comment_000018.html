<p>Your post is catching up steam in Korea. As you alluded to before we know it sucks, we just dids't act on it. I'm now curious as to why this didn't happen by the local hackers, 'cause they are plenty skilled.</p>
<p>I had to learn what TAN is and it does seem similar to what korean banks do with the security card. However, number on the security card is never meant to be disclosed in full. The bank will ask only the first or last 2 digits of the requested code. The card usually contains about 48 4-digit numbers and bank randomly asks for 2. We knew this was ripe for abuse as well (people took photos of the entire card for example) and nowadays it's a dying breed. The default for years has been a dedicated hardware number generator (OTP), however without any input besides a power button.</p>
