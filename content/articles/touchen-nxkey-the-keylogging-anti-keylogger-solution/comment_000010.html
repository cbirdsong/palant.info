<p>Wouldn't it be better to use the widesperead use of this extension and use it as a sort of zero trust access model. First it checks whether you have basic security measures in place (browser up2date and an OSup2date) and only then gives the customer access to the banking website?</p>
<p>They can also warn if they access a fake banking website and add other functionality</p>
<p>Then the extension is just improved (no one loses face) and people keep on using the extension.
So basically, all about the app is pretty mediocre/useless but since so many people are used to have the extension installed, leverage it.</p>
