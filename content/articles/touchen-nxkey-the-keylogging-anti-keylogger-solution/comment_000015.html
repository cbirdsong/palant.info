<p>Many thanks from South Korea. I really hope this post to bring a massive impact but unfortunately I'm somewhat skeptical to it.</p>
<p>Theses "so-called" security software companies are not interested in computer security at all. To them, security is just about marking down the checklist provided by the government. The only thing they're interested in is to sell their product to government and financial entities. Software quality is out of question because only a few companies control the market and quality differences between those companies are essentially the same. They have virtually no incentives to fix these security holes unless incident <em>actually</em> happens.</p>
<p>I think things are gonna change after more than millions of dollars are actually stolen with these exploits.</p>
<p>But we need to make this a political agenda and we need more public awareness. I'm thankful for your in-depth efforts. Let's hope it makes a meaningful impact.</p>
