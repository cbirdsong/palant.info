<p>Yes, I’ve seen this article. It’s weird how they decided to discuss the choice of programming languages when I brought up a dozen actual security issues. As to the fix they supposedly developed, I’ve updated the blog post accordingly five days ago already: “In comments to Korean media, RaonSecure claims to have fixed the vulnerabilities and to distribute the update to customers. I cannot currently confirm this claim. The company’s own download server is still distributing TouchEn nxKey 1.0.0.78.”</p>
