<p>Worst thing these so called security programs in the past did was that they trained people to relax their security settings for both Windows and Internet Explorer and trained people to allow any programs to be installed so they can get on with online banking and commerce. So people were purposefully disabling various security measure to install these junk software. I suspect this also did lot of harm to people who did not know better and was just following bad instructions which was required to install these software which would also allow various malwares to be installed easily.</p>
