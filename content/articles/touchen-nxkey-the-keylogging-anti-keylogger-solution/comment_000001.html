<p>I have been hoping Korean security companies which sell “security solutions” to notice:
- obscurity is NOT security
- there are security researchers whom their legal threats cannot reach to
- “vulnerability disclosure” finishes when the fix is deployed, not when they’re aware of the vulnerability</p>
<p>And I think you’re helping them to notice this. Big kudos for your work!</p>
