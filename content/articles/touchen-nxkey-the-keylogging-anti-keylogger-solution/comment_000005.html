<p>Kudos to your work.
The lack of care for sharing sensitive information is prevailant in the counrty unfortunately. 
As my previous comment mentions, most "security" programming is outsourced to smaller or even just freelancer developers to cut the cost in most cases, resulting in sometimes they aren't even aware of what level of security said project needs.</p>
