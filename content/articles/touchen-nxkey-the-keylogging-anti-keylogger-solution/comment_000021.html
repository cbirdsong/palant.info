<p>Recently, a personal information leak of 20 million records occurred at LG in South Korea. 
Information such as names, resident registration numbers, phone numbers, home addresses, postal codes, encrypted passwords, device information, birthdays, email addresses and other sensitive information were leaked. 
Unfortunately, personal information leaks occur frequently and are severe in South Korea, causing consumers to become numb to such incidents. Many people have come to the realization that their personal information has already been widely distributed, especially to countries like China and North Korea. This is indeed the case in reality.
Furthermore, there is often little compensation for victims and fines for companies are peanut in comparison.</p>
