<p>Great job! Much appreciated. I always suspected that these "security" apps were at best bogus. Your work demonstrated that they are in fact security threats!
It is a shame that app providers or banks did not do anything even though they were duly informed. I wonder what they will have to say when their systems are exploited and account info is compromised...</p>
