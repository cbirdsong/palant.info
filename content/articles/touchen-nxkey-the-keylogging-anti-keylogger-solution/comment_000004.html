<p>Great work.
Its funny that for your last question, a malicious JavaScript code could be impelemented so that the user would not even notice it. It could capture the credentials, get the public key to encrypt the credentials and input them into the hidden fields. The login would work hence the attacker stole the credentials.</p>
