<p>Greetings, besides being an article copied from another source, the definition is wrong. There is no solid basis for what you explain; besides the explanation is confusing, flattering and unclear. Jquery in its latest versions is a 100% safe product to use. The only insecure thing is the bad practices of many programmers, which leads to failures in applications, and of course, it is easier to blame someone else (JQuery) than to assume our mistakes.</p>
<p>Besides you compare "Fetch API" with Jquery when both are two different things, you can only compare "Fetch API" with the AJAX method of Jquery, when Jquery has hundreds of capabilities that are beyond the scope of "Fetch API" which only serves for API communication.</p>
