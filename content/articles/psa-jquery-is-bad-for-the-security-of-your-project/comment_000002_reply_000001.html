<p>I’m interested to learn about that “another source” that I supposedly copied the article from.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to read the article. I don’t claim that jQuery is insecure per se. It rather encourages insecure coding practices, largely for reasons that used to be relevant more than a decade ago. And I found plenty of security vulnerabilities that wouldn’t be there, had the developers used a more modern framework.</p>
<p>I also don’t compare Fetch API with jQuery as a whole. It clearly says there: “We don’t need jQuery to do <em>downloads</em>” – it’s an example, a particular area where jQuery used to be relevant but no longer is.</p>
