<p>Great confirmation of my suspicion. I had to install many of these security addons,
and was a nightmare to get it to run. Often I just gave up.</p>
<p>And it felt always super insecure, with all these strange addons doing extra stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, maybe one day these things get finally banned or there is enough pressure
to stop this madness.</p>
