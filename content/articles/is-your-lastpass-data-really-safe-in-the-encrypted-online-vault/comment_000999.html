<p>I know this is an old posting, but I have a question about the numbers given for testing passwords against a hash using 5,000 PBKDF2 iterations.</p>
<p>You claim a 1080Ti can do 346000 guesses/s</p>
<p>The page you're referring to says 1730.9 kH/s which given 5000 iterations gives me 1730.9*10^3/5000=346.18 which is a factor 1000 less than what you state.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here?</p>
