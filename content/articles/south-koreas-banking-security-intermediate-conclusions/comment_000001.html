<p>Certificates (or public certificates) are just couple of files that can be stolen along with passphrase through fake applications that are reported dating back to at least a decade or more. (<a href="http://m.newsshare.co.kr/12199" rel="nofollow">2011</a>, <a href="http://www.speconomy.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=18876" rel="nofollow">2013</a>) account lock doesn't really function on certificates as they are normally stored to a certain directory in PCs and smartphones instead of hardware tokens. offline brute force attack is possible if hackers only obtained certificate files. nothing has changed since then and they still have strong legal validity that certificate holder will most likely bear burden of proof.</p>
