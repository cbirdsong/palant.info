<p>I'm an PC and mobile phone banking developer working at major bank in South Korea. Contrary to your perspectives, There are no movements to apply user-oriented security measures(2-factor auth or Physical One Time Password) entirely and remove the software. All of Chief Information Security Officers in South Korea Banks believe that the Softwares (they called "Security Programs") installed on customer terminals is the best endpoint security measure, and they advertise it as the optimal solution for customers.After your articles, the manufactures of security programs are announced "Updates" (solved version the vulnerability you raised) and Banks are start to depoly. That's it. Nothing more than that. Sadly, I think the CISOs believe it is cheaper than 2-factor auth or OTP. They just concerns about "cost" not "safety for customers".</p>
