<p>Thanks for the reply! I did uncompress, but I still don't see keepa sending data like this through the WebSocket to the server. It looks like keepa is just sending data from their server, but nothing significant from the client (eg. asin, username, domain, etc.)</p>
<p>Is it possible that keepa stopped scraping in the background since you posted this article? </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing the knowledge!</p>
