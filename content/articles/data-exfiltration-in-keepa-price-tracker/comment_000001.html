<p>Interesting.  They are using the extension users to scrape Amazon's site for data, which they then put into their databases.  They're getting around Amazon API limits by not calling the APIs themselves, they're flagrantly violating Amazon's "do not scrape pages" policy.  Keepa is seriously violating Amazon's TOS.</p>
<p>I doubt, however, that them collecting Amazon's catalog info and using your connection to do it, actually violates any privacy policies/requirements though, even with the EUs rather.. stringent.. requirements.</p>
