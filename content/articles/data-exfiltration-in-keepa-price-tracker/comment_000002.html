<p>Thanks for the insight! Quick question, I am trying to follow your post, but I can't seem to find where the browser sends the following to the server:
{
  "payload": [null],
  "scrapedData": {
    "tld": "de"
  },
  "ratings": [{
    "rating": "4,3",
    "ratingCount": "2.924",
    "asin": "B0719M4YZB"
  }],
  "key": "f1",
  "domainId": 3
}</p>
<p>I'm loading a product and checking the websocket messages and I don't see anything like this. I'm interested in learning how these extensions work. Where should I be looking? Thanks!</p>
