<p>i like keepa. i have come up with the following compromise that i feel comfortable with...</p>
<p>1) use firefox with the 'temporary containers' extension. normal amazon browsing is done in temporary throwaway containers by default, and then i have a persistent container where i'm logged in.
2) use a user script (via 'tampermonkey' or whatever you like) to inject keepa price tracker iframe into amazon product pages in temp containers. also create a (sanitized) link that can open that product page in the persistent amazon container if you want to buy something. this can be done with 'Open external links in a container' extension.</p>
