<p>I’m tired of whataboutism and I’d be grateful if you could stay away from my blog. I don’t live in the US, and I’m not criticizing Xiaomi because they are a Chinese company – I’m criticizing them because they are doing bad things. Do you have proof of a US company doing something similar? I’ll be happy to verify your results and help you spread the word. But if you don’t have anything of value to contribute, please just stay quiet.</p>
