<p>I'm not sure how Java operates around variable reassignment, but I noticed that <code>this.c = c</code> is the first argument to the original call to <code>SensorsDataAPI.sharedInstance</code>, which (in the languages I tend to use) would make <code>this.c</code> retain the value of whatever was passed to this class's initializer as <code>final Context c</code>.</p>
<p>Those calls to <code>this.c</code> could be calls to something else entirely, is what I'm getting at, basically</p>
