<p>As I said above, I’m tired of whataboutism. Please read the article (better <a href="https://palant.info/2020/05/08/what-data-does-xiaomi-collect-about-you/" rel="nofollow">this one, without technical details</a>) and think again: what other browser invades your privacy on the same level? And since you don’t seem to know: no, Google Chrome certainly has its privacy issues but it is nowhere near this level of creepy. Mozilla Firefox has its faults as well by they are still the good guys trying to do the right thing. I’ve been dealing with browsers a lot, and so far Avast Secure Browser has been the only one doing something similar.</p>
<p>The other products you mention operate on a totally different level and are not comparable.</p>
