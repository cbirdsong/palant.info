<p>I did not have to approach Xiaomi, Forbes did that already. And Xiaomi published <a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2020/05/02/live-post-evidence-and-statement-in-response-to-media-coverage-on-our-privacy-policy/" rel="nofollow">their response</a>. Which explains: no, there is no reason for this functionality beyond “insight” and “product improvement”. And besides, it’s legal.</p>
<p>They also implemented a “fix” for the issue. If you switch “Incognito mode” on and “Enhanced incognito mode” off then no data will be collected. 🤡</p>
<p>No, I did not jump to conclusions too quickly. I know very well what kind of data other browsers send out. This is nothing like that.</p>
