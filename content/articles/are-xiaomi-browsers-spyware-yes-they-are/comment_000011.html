<p>I thank you very much for this in-depth analysis. I've been debating about moving away from Samsung and going to Xiaomi for my next phone just based on price.  I mean almost half price for practically the same specs?  But I'd be worried about baked in spyware.
My question is - Does all of this spyware issue go away if you flash a new rom to the phone?  Like flashing vanilla Android or maybe LineageOS?</p>
