<p>Are Xiaomi browsers spyware? 
They are, same as: Google Chrome, Mozilla, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, instagram, Apple Store, Amazon, MacOS, Windows etc (in one word everyone).
Basically any app that has access to any of your information, collects your information.
All the companies collecting the data swear that they will not misuse this data (and that is pretty much all we can hope for).
Not sure why you are pinpointing Xiaomi's not very popular browser, you are making it sound like it is doing something unheard of.
People don't really care (at least large majority of people).</p>
