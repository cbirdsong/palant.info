<p>Thank you for this blog post. We are a new user of LastPass (joined Dec 2022) and are shocked to hear about all of this - and so soon after we thought we were securing things down by using a password manager at all. </p>
<p>I followed the link to the lastpast support site to change the iterations and this what their site currently says, "Within the "Security" section, for the Password Iterations field, enter your desired number of rounds (our minimum recommendation is 600000 rounds)." So, it looks like they are no longer even suggesting 100100 iterations anymore... The maddening part is that they aren't proactively taking care of their customers, leaving each of us to independently 'up our game' on the security.</p>
