<p>When it comes to random passwords, Iâ€™m usually saying how long it takes to guess it on average. Yes, there is a tiny chance that a password taking 900 years on average will be guessed on the first day (0.00015%), but this is irrelevant in practice. We could just as well talk about the chances of an asteroid destroying the Earth tomorrow and preventing the guessing.</p>
