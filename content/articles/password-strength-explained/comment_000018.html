<p>Great easy-to-understand article! Thankfully I came across the XKCD comic years ago and have used such a passphrase ever since as my password manager's master password. Would the entropy actually go up if I were to use words from different languages? Say "correctchevalbateriagraffetta" instead of "correcthorsebatterystaple"?</p>
