<p>The password length is growing “automatically” as the complexity of the guesses increases. The other factors need to be guessed, though these don’t add as many entropy bits as one would wish.</p>
<p>Of course, anything that’s known about the password helps weed out wrong guesses early. So a vendor storing password complexity information next to the hashed password actually makes the password easier to guess. Same goes for any boasting about one’s passwords on social networks.</p>
