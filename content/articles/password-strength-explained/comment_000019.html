<p>Related to the topic of password strength, I'd be interested in your thoughts on the practice of various websites / corporate environments requiring users to change our password every 30 / 60 / 90 days. If we're all using a strong(ish) password with a combination of upper/lower-case letters, numbers &amp; symbols etc, are using separate passwords for each site and are storing these in a password safe, is there any benefit in having to change passwords all the time? I am regularly frustrated by the requirement and see no benefit in it.</p>
