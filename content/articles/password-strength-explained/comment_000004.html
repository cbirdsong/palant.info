<p>I tend to use a short sentence, maybe 8 words or so with punctuation and some numbers based on how easy it would be for me to type quickly. For example: "I feel it's 7ecure, am I fooling myself?". Granted, can be a little annoying to punch out on a phone but once I'm comfortable typing it on a keyboard it's very fast.</p>
