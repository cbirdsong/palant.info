<p>There are still parts to the password guessing game that I donâ€™t understand.  For instance, though the bad guys may generate several million guesses at my password, my bank / email / medical records etc. would lock out after three attempts.  So how do they keep entering guesses and not get locked out?  Am I missing something obvious?</p>
