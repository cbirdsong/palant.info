<p>How badly is entropy affected in the diceware scheme if I reroll the dice until I find some "cool" passphrase?</p>

<p>If an attacker knows which word list was used, the number of words used, and the fact that the user tried to go after a "cool" passphrase, then wouldn't they try to test for passphrase that seem "cool" to the average person first? By only going after passphrases that sound "cool", you end up introducing a human factor into it again...</p>
