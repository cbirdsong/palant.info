<p>As long as there is a server limiting the number of attempts – yes, 1000 guesses per second are unrealistic. This is the relevant number for the scenario where someone managed to steal the data (e.g. from the vendor’s backup servers like in LastPass’ case) or the vendor themselves has turned evil. Since they already have the data then, they merely need to decrypt it and there is no attempt limiting. The limiting factor are only the capabilities of modern hardware.</p>
<p>And then 1000 guesses per second are an ideal scenario. For LastPass, their most current settings allowed 88 thousand guesses per second on a single graphics card. And they left plenty of accounts on extremely outdated settings, for some this meant 8.8 billion (!) guesses per second on the same graphics card.</p>
