<p>In all the discussions on password entropy, i have never seen anything that takes into account that surely the attacker also needs to guess the length and format of the password for these entropy numbers to be valid?
Or is there some simple way that an attacker can establish password length, character set or password format from the encrypted blob before they start guessing?
Please could you explain what am i missing here?
Thanks</p>
