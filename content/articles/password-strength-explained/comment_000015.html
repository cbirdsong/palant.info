<p>Wladimir,</p>
<p>You are too smart. Wicked smart. I have been using computers for years and thought I was clever with passwords. Your astute comments here have left me feeling like a village idiot. </p>
<p>I guess my task now is to find a way to remember random words to use as a master password. Not sure if stapling a correct horse to a battery will work for me. Or was that a battered horse with the correct staple? Good Grief!</p>
