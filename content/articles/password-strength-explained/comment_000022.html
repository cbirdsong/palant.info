<p>I've been studying password strength for a while. 
I'm not a fan of the passphrase idea. 4 words.. even 5 or 6 is not sufficient. 
Let's take correct horse staple battery as the sample. a 20 char password is not bad in the traditional sense.
But lets ignore the old alphabet. treat each word as letter. now your password is only 4 characters long, and your "alphabet" is the top 15K words in the english dictionary.
When I do public talks, I recommend to include extended ascii and utf32 chars in your password. Some services do allow it. I have passwords that contain emoji's. On windows, open notepad, then hold down ALT, and type 3 numbers on the keypad. This will give you interesting chars like ╚, §, σ, ├ etc.... use these in your password. (does not work on mac and linux) It is keyboard typable, so you can use it to unlock your OS and password manager. And since we should not be typing our passwords anymore, you can go crazy with the passwords in your password manager. 25 char, using the entire UTF32 space. This ends up with entropy of 200 - 230. Good luck cracking that beast. How long before quantum computing is commercially available?</p>
