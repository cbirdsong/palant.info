<p>It seems to me the problem is the 1000 guesses per second thing. Usually my dumb luck is that I've mistyped my password 3 times and get locked out for an hour, a day, or until support unlocks it for me. Which systems are allowing 1000 guesses a second? That seems like a dead giveaway to me that a brute force hack is underway. Even if we only talk about the password managers, shouldn't they be restricting repeated password attempts already?</p>
<p>Fascinating topic - thanks for writing about it!</p>
